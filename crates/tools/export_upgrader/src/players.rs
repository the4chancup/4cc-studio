//! Steps 2-4 for the face folders and the boots and gloves folders
//! (`spec/export_upgrader.md` steps 2-4): each face folder becomes its player
//! folder under `Players/`, named by the plan's order (the face folder's name
//! part, the worn boots folder's, the worn gloves folder's, the save's name,
//! the number alone), its portrait renamed `portrait.dds` and its
//! `ingame_face` spellings normalized to `ingame_face.toml`. A boots or gloves folder one player wears
//! merges into his folder on a Fox export; one worn by two or more, or any
//! worn one on a pre-Fox export, stays a named shared folder with a link file.
//! Each slot's output folder lands in `PlayerFolders::folders` for step 8's
//! `settings.toml` (`settings.rs`); a referee export's folders are
//! `referees.rs`'s, and loose mode pairs each item folder's wearer from its
//! ID's position in its kind's old block of 25 (step 11).
