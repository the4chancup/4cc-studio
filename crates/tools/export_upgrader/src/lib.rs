//! The Export upgrader: exports in the old (AET) layout migrated to the Studio
//! player-folder format the Team compiler reads (`plans/export_upgrader.md`).
//!
//! `Tool` registers the tool with the shell: its help chapter and its
//! `export-upgrader` command line. The window is a later phase's; until then
//! `view` shows a placeholder line. The migration itself lives in `upgrade`:
//! the old export is read through `source`, its Note through `note`, the
//! roster through `roster`, the player folders planned by `players`, the kit
//! folders by `kits`, the carried folders by `carried`, the `.mtl` rewrites
//! by `materials`, the `face.xml` respells by `face_xml`, the kit magic by
//! `kit_magic`, the pre-Fox model renames by `model_names`, the
//! `settings.toml` files by `settings`, the output's name through `naming`,
//! and every finding goes through the `messages` catalog.
