//! The toolbar's ruleset dropdown (the draft's `rulesetPicker`): the AATF
//! rulesets built into the binary by description, in the templates'
//! order, then under a separator the imported ones by description, each
//! with an × removing it, then under another `Import rules file…`, a
//! command rather than a ruleset. A pick writes `view.aatf_ruleset`,
//! which `Tool::view` writes back to the setting; the next frame's `show`
//! resolves it, and the caches keyed to the ruleset follow. The import and
//! the × do their file work in `session::rules` and show its outcome in
//! their dialogs (`dialog`).
