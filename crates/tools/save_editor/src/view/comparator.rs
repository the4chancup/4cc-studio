//! The comparator panel (`plans/save_editor.md` "Comparator (gameplay +
//! aesthetics)"; the draft's `comparatorPanel`): an `egui::Window` comparing
//! the open save, edits included, against a picked second save of the same
//! version — each row picked → open in the views' terms (`terms::row_term`),
//! the rows grouped per team, a row's click selecting the player. The
//! comparison runs on a worker thread (two real PES 2021 saves differ in
//! 34,379 rows, about half a second), started when its key — the open
//! save's revision, the picked save's and the scope — moves on and the edit
//! has settled (`edit_settled`, the same condition the undo stack's seal
//! uses); until the reply lands the last result stays, marked `Comparing…`,
//! and a frame draws only the rows in view (`ScrollArea::show_rows`). The
//! team filter narrows the held list on the frame, so it starts no run;
//! Export writes the scope's `diff::report_lines` over the whole save, the
//! filter notwithstanding — the text `save-editor diff` prints.
