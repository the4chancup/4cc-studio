A player's row opens the player view: his id and name on top, then three
columns side by side, with the collapsed **Appearance** section underneath.

The first column is his **General info**: name and shirt name, height, weight,
age, nationality, shirt number and captaincy, stronger foot and hand, registered
position and playing style. Under it are **Other stats** (form, injury
resistance, weak foot usage and accuracy) and his **Playable positions** with
their C/B/A ratings: the chosen rating is filled, green for A, blue for B, grey
for C, and his registered position's cell is outlined; a click on a position's
name makes it his registered position. The second column is his
**Skills** and **COM playing styles**. The third is his **Ability stats**.

Between Skills and COM playing styles a second skills panel stands when
the rules in use set some cards apart: **Tricks** holds the ruleset's
tricks, which its free trick allowance usually covers, and a ruleset
without tricks shows **Free cards** instead, the skills its free-card
rules name, including those free only for a tier, a position or the
captain.

**Counts.** The Name and Shirt labels count what the field holds, as typed:
`(12/61)` reads as 12 bytes used of the 61 the field holds (a colour code counts
as the ten bytes it stores). The shirt name counts letters, 18 on most versions
and 16 on PES 2016. When a name or shirt name is longer than every version can
hold, the field and its count turn amber, and hovering them says what an older
game would do with it.

The numbers are the game's own, the same ones the game's Edit mode shows: abilities
run 40 to 99, form 1 to 8, weak foot 1 to 4. A value the save holds
outside a range is shown as stored, and it changes only when you edit it.

A greyed control is one the save's PES version does not have: hover it and the
tooltip names the first version that does (for example PES 19+). The same fields
stay in the same places on every version, so the page never rearranges.

**Cards left** counts the paid cards the player has left under his own tier of
the AATF rules in use (the rules file chosen in the settings menu's Save editor
section, or the built-in official rules when none is chosen): the tier is the
one the rules read him as, the way the AATF check does, from his stats,
registered position and height, and the paid cards are the skills and COM
playing styles that count against that tier's limit. When no tier's condition
holds for him the badge says "No tier matches". The number goes red when he
holds more than the limit. When the rules file does not load there is no badge:
the red line under the player list says so, and a click on it shows the error.
When the rules cannot read the player's tier, the badge's place reads "Tier
check failed, click for more information.", and a click shows why.
