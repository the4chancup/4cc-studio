The **Player** menu works on the selected player:

- **Set all stats…** gives every ability stat the same value, 40 to 99,
  and the dialog's value starts at his Attacking Prowess. Weak foot, form and injury
  are not ability stats and stay as they are.
- **Bump all stats…** (Ctrl+B) adds the same amount, -10 to +10, to every
  ability stat, clamped to 40 to 99. The dialog remembers the last amount
  used in this window.
- **Toggle FPC settings** (Ctrl+I) follows the Appearance section's FPC
  reading: it shows a player who reads "The default body is currently
  hidden" and hides any other, the same write as the section's Show
  default body and Hide default body. A player hidden by his model's own
  boots ID reads "The default body is currently shown", so for him the
  toggle hides him again. Use the section's Show default body on him. It
  stays disabled while the aesthetics lock is on (see the Appearance
  section).
- **Copy stats from…** copies another player's stats onto the selected
  one; **Swap stats with…** trades them. The other player is picked by
  team, then by roster slot. Height, weight, every ability, form, injury,
  weak foot, positions, playing style, skills and COM styles, stronger
  foot and hand, star, playing attitude, the free-kick motion and the
  gameplay edit flags move with the stats; names, nationality, age, the
  other motions and every appearance field stay as they are.

Every operation is one undoable step. Set all stats and Bump all stats
write the same fields the player view's abilities and skills part edits, so they set no
edit flag. Copy and Swap stats move the gameplay edit flags with the
stats.

**Generate settings.toml…** and **Generate in-game face…** write the
selected player's look to a player folder of your choice, the files a team
moving to compile-time aesthetics is built from. `settings.toml` holds
everything but the in-game face: the names, the stock boots and gloves IDs,
skin colour, physique, strip and motions. `ingame_face.toml` holds the
in-game face itself: iris colour, face and hair. The save cannot say which
players wear the in-game face, so you choose per player whether to generate
it, and neither writes the save. A stripped player is skipped, because the game
reads the tables rather than his save data. When the folder already holds a
`settings.toml`, its comments stay while the values become the player's.
`ingame_face.toml` is written whole.
