The collapsed **Appearance** section at the bottom of the player view holds his
look: the game's own edit flags, his
physique, his strip style, his motions, and his skin and iris colours.

The **Cutscenes** group comes first and stays editable when the rest is
locked. Star and playing attitude only change how the player appears in
cutscenes, so they are not part of the look the team's export owns.

**When it is locked.** A player's look can belong to his team's export: the
export's `settings.toml` and models decide it, and the Team compiler writes
it into the save (through the aesthetics patch on older games, through the
database tables on PES 2018 and newer). A hand edit here would be silently
overwritten the next time the team is recompiled or patched. That is what
**Aesthetics from exports** in the Save editor's Settings section is for:
with it on, the section and every other aesthetics path open read-only behind
the ownership line, for a cup whose looks are compiled from exports. It is
off by default, for the cups whose looks live in the save, so every control
then edits and no ownership line or switch is drawn.

**Edit aesthetics anyway** draws under the setting and unlocks the section for
the rest of the session, for the cases the rule does not cover: a team
with no export, or a cup-night fix when recompiling is not an option.
Opening another save keeps it unlocked. Starting the tool again turns it
back off. On a save of PES 2017 or older the note under the switch warns
that a later patch overwrites whatever you edit by hand. On a
stripped save (below) it warns that the game still reads the motions, but
takes the look from the database tables.

A player marked **stripped** takes his look from the database tables, not from
his save data (his appearance id is -1): the game's Edit mode restores the id
on any change, so the looks for him go through the export, never through this
section. His motions, the Motion flag and, on PES 2018, the Base copy flag still
apply, because they sit in the part of the save data the game reads even for a
stripped player. When a save of PES 2018 or newer opens with some players
stripped and some not, a window lists the ones still carrying an appearance
id, and **Strip again** sets them back to -1 in one undoable step.

**Randomize** draws new values for the hunching, arm movement, kick and
celebration motions, each within the range the game's Edit mode offers, and
the dribbling motion is left as it is. One Undo restores them all.

The **Full Player Customization** group, last in the section, is where FPC
invisibility lives: the save's own reading of the player, then **Hide body**
and **Show body**. The reading says "FPC: the body is hidden" when his boots
ID in the save is the hide ID from Settings (55 unless changed) or his skin
is Custom, and "FPC: the body is shown" otherwise. A player hidden by his
model's own boots ID, such as a compile-allocated one, reads "the body is
shown", because the save cannot tell his model hides him, which is why these
are two buttons and not a checkbox. Hide body writes long sleeves, a tucked
shirt and short socks, and a boots or gloves ID of 0 takes the hide ID from
Settings (55 and 11 unless changed, while a model's own ID is kept). Show body
writes short sleeves, an untucked shirt and standard socks, and a boots or
gloves ID that holds the hide ID goes back to 0. On PES 2015 to 2017 both
also turn a Custom skin into Light. Changing the setting rewrites no save,
so a player hidden with the old ID then reads "the body is shown", and Show
body leaves his ID alone (it is no longer the hide ID). Under the reading
the group lists the strip settings that would interfere with a hidden body
(inners or undershorts that break the hiding, taping that still shows) and
the gloves checkbox with ID 0, which gives winter gloves to any player. They
are reported, never changed for you. The inners, undershorts and taping
follow the save's own reading, so they are listed only for a player the save
calls hidden. A player hidden by his model's own boots ID (a
compile-allocated one such as 627) reads "the body is shown", and they are
not listed for him, though the game hides his body all the same.
The Team compiler's check knows the folder's FPC marker, so it reports them
for a compiled team.
