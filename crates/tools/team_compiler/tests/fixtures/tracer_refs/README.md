# Referee tracer fixture

One real referee with models in his `face/`, `boots/` and `gloves/` subfolders and textures in
his `common/`, mapped to three slots, as an old-layout referee export, the Export upgrader's
output for it, and Red's compiled output for the old one, for PES 2021: the referee
counterpart of `../tracer/`, compared by the referee case of `tests/parity.rs`. It has no
hand-made Studio twin: the upgraded export is the one compiled. The scripts that made it are
in `scripts/provenance/tracer_refs/`.

## `old/refs Tracer/`

Cut down by `make_old.py` from the Fox referee export "refs lan party"
(`C:\Data\4cc\4cc aet compiler\Test_stuff\refs lan party` on the writing machine, copied before
the cut), the one Fox referee export there whose referees use the old `face/`, `boots/`,
`gloves/` and `common/` subfolders: the cup's referee exports there (Winter 25 to Summer 26)
are pre-Fox, and the other Fox one, `refs fox test`, is a single-referee test with no
`common/`. The referee is `masterchef`, one of the export's two referees whose `gloves/` holds
models (`glove_l.fmdl`, `glove_r.fmdl`; the others' holds only `glove.fpk.xml`), the other one,
`takemeback`, being 25 MB to his 10 MB. Changes from the source:

- the other twelve referees are left out, and `Refs.txt` (the source's spelling, CRLF kept)
  keeps the three lines naming `masterchef`, `05`, `23` and `24`, so one folder backing
  several slots stays in the cut;
- to keep the tree small, `common/arm_1_bsm.dds` and `common/masterchef.dds` (DXT5,
  2048×2048) keep every eighth 4×4 block in each direction (256×256), `common/hat.dds` (DXT5,
  1024×1024) every fourth (256×256); headers are rewritten to match, the format is unchanged.

Everything else is byte-identical to the source: `boots/boots.fmdl` and `boots.skl`,
`gloves/glove_l.fmdl` and `glove_r.fmdl`, `common/normal.dds` and `spec.dds`, `face/face_diff.bin`
(the face folder holds no model), and the three `*.fpk.xml` files.

## `upgraded/refs Tracer upgraded/`

What the Export upgrader makes of `old/`, as it wrote it. Made at commit `b496f48` by
`4cc-studio export-upgrader upgrade "old/refs Tracer" -o <dir>` (a referee export takes neither
`--savefile` nor `--loose`; report: `migration_clean`, exit 0; the name gains ` upgraded`, a
referee export taking no coverage tag); `export_upgrader`'s tests check that upgrading `old/`
still gives exactly this tree, so a change to the upgrader's output regenerates it the same
way. Against `old/`:

- `Refs.txt` is gone and a root `players.txt` maps the same three slots, one LF line each;
- `Players/masterchef/` holds every file of the four subfolders at its root under its own name,
  the three `*.fpk.xml` files left out;
- the three models' texture references into `common/`, `/Assets/pes16/model/character/common/000/sourceimages/<name>`,
  are repointed to `./`, where the flattened files now are.

## `red/`

The entries of the referee CPK Red compiled from `old/` (`4cc_35_referees.cpk`, 63 files; Red
writes no team CPK for a run holding a referee export alone), extracted as stored with the
`cpk` crate. Red 4.4.0, commit `1a48fa5` of `4cc-aet-compiler-red`, branch `main`, run from a
copy of its folder (`setup_red.py`) with `settings.ini` at its defaults except
`pes_version = 21`, `cpk_name = 4cc_90_tracer`, `move_cpks = 0`, `pause_allow = 0`,
`updates_check = 0`, and `pes_folder_path` pointing at a folder that does not exist. Command:
`Engines\embed\python.exe Engines\compiler_main.py 0 --no-pause` with
`exports_to_add\refs Tracer\`: "No issues were found". Its 31 referee template entries
(`Asset/model/character/uniform/texture/#windx11/referee_*.ftex`, `RefereeAppearance.bin`, the
20 `referee/referee_*.bin` kit configs) are byte-identical to `resources/templates/referees_fox/`.

What the comparison found when it was written, compiling `upgraded/` for PES 21 (the parity
test's table carries each row):

- each slot's `k99NN` boots FPK and `g99NN` gloves FPK holds the same members, the `.skl`
  byte-identical; the three models decode to the same model, texture table included: Red and
  the compiler both point the `common/` textures at the referee's name-keyed common folder,
  `/Assets/pes16/model/character/common/999/masterchef/sourceimages/`. The model bytes differ
  in the string table alone, where Red rewrote the old directory strings in place and the
  compiler appends the new ones, the old ones left unreferenced;
- the five textures are at the same paths with the same headers and pixels
  (`masterchef.ftex` byte-identical, the others differing in their zlib chunks only);
- the `.fpkd` files and the 31 template entries are byte-identical;
- Red writes a `referee0NN` face FPK holding `face_diff.bin` alone for each slot; the compiler
  writes no face for a referee whose folder holds no face model, so the game's own referee
  head stays (`spec/team_compiler/blue_port.md` "Referee export processing"), and reports
  `face_diff.bin` as `face_file_not_used`;
- Red copies the source-side `*.fpk.xml` files into the output; the Studio format drops them;
- the compiler also writes the team side, `4cc_99_test.cpk`, for the bins alone: on PES 18-21
  each referee kit config is also its entry in `UniformParameter.bin`
  (`spec/team_compiler/pipeline.md` "5. Writer (single-threaded)", its item "Output modes and
  targets"), whose 20 referee entries are Red's 20 files byte for byte over the bundled
  `UniformParameter19.bin`, beside the bundled `TeamColor.bin` and `UniColor.bin` unchanged.

The three trees are about 7 MB on disk; git stores identical files once, so the three slots'
copies of each FPK, the textures `old/` and `upgraded/` share and the template entries
`resources/` already holds add nothing, and the fixture adds about 1.9 MB of compressed
objects to the repository (the tracers about 0.8 MB each), most of it the 758 KB boots model in its three forms (`old/`, Red's FPK,
`upgraded/`). It is committed whole rather than as a hash manifest (`testing.md` "Testing:
parity against Red (adapted from Blue)") so the parity test runs anywhere, CI included,
without Red.
