//! The working bins taken from the installed CPKs (`team_compiler/pipeline.md` "Bins
//! accumulation"): the bins the game would load from the CPKs `download/DpFileList.bin` lists
//! before the run's own, so a compiled CPK, which the game loads above them, keeps the cup's
//! colors and kits for every team the run does not compile. Each bin comes from the nearest of
//! those CPKs that holds it, and from its bundled base when none does or the walk cannot be
//! made (no PES folder, no list, a list not naming the run's CPK); a Fox player table, which
//! has no bundled base, is then absent. In multi-CPK mode the run's own CPK is the bins CPK,
//! whose installed copy the three player tables' walk starts at: it holds the seed rows of
//! the players no export compiles, which the run's output replaces. The walk passes over the
//! installed refs CPK when the run writes one, since the run replaces it (`pipeline.md` "5.
//! Writer", step 5). The same walk keeps every entry path of the CPKs below the boundary, for
//! the texture lookup (`pipeline.md` "Resolved decisions", "A texture a model names must
//! exist"), which `check` makes too, reading no bin.
//! On PES 15-17 it also gathers the loose kit configs (`WorkingBins::loose_kit_configs`).
