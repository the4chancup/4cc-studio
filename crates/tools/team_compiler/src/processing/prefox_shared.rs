//! A pre-Fox boots or gloves output (`team_compiler/pipeline.md` "3. Per-model-folder parallel
//! steps", step 7): loose files in the shape of the game's own boots and glove folders, written
//! under an id. A `Boots/` or `Gloves/` folder a player links plainly is written once under its
//! shared id; an `ingame_face` player's own boots and gloves, his parts of each (the Common
//! models his `.common` links copy in included, with the `.mtl` each uses) and the models of a
//! folder of their kind his link combines, under his exclusive id (`player_folders.md`
//! "`ingame_face` marker", "`ingame_face` with shared links"). Boots are one model as
//! `boots.model` and the `.mtl` it uses as `boots.mtl`, the names the game loads, several
//! models merged into one (`pes_model::ops::merge`); gloves are each model and the `.mtl`
//! files they use under their own names lowercased, listed in a generated `glove.xml`,
//! unmerged. An `.fmdl` among the models is converted as the face converts one (`pipeline.md`
//! step 3 "Format conversion"), its `.model` and material set taking the place of a member's
//! `.model` and the `.mtl` it uses; a `.model` the conversion pre-check finds posed off the
//! version's skeleton is moved onto it as the face moves one, the `.mtl` it uses packed as
//! written. A shared folder's textures sit beside them
//! (`TextureHome::SharedOutput`), the `.mtl` paths naming them `./<stem>.dds`; a player's are
//! in his common folder (`TextureHome::PlayerCommon`), named as his face's `.mtl` files name
//! them, and a Common `.mtl`'s stay in the team's Common output. `materialize` writes the files
//! into the output's folder.
