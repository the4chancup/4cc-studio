//! The referees' marker (`team_compiler/blue_port.md` "Referee export processing"): the refs
//! export's `ref_marker.dds` converted as a Common texture is, shown under every referee. On
//! Fox it goes out in the referees' Common output, with a flat square written as the referees'
//! reserved collar, the bundled marker FMDL, its texture pointed at it. On pre-Fox it goes out
//! as the referee template tree's prop texture, in place of the tree's own: a `.mtl` beside a
//! nocloth model stops that model drawing (in game on PES 17, 2026-10-09), so a collar cannot
//! carry the marker there, and the prop the game draws under the referee by itself takes it.
