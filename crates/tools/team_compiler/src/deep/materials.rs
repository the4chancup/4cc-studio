//! The deep pass's texture lookup for a pre-Fox `.mtl` (`team_compiler/messages.md`, the
//! paragraph after "Texture existence is checked **deep**"): each texture path a `.mtl` names
//! must be supplied, by the stem rule the face task points the paths with
//! (`processing::prefox_face`; on Fox, which reads only a `.mtl` a selected `.model` pairs
//! with, the Models task, `processing::model`), so a path this calls supplied is one the task
//! points and a path it calls missing is one the task leaves as written. A missing texture of
//! a material a paired model's mesh binds is `mtl_texture_not_found`, a Warning that keeps
//! what holds the `.mtl`: which samplers a pre-Fox shader reads is not known, and the game
//! plays faces with such a miss. One only materials no mesh binds name is
//! `mtl_texture_unused_missing`, an Info, since the game never loads it.
