//! Staging, promotion and deployment (`team_compiler/pipeline.md` "6. Post-processing"): a CPK,
//! or a test or sideload run's loose tree, is written in a staging folder of its own run and only
//! then moved to its final path, so a failed run never leaves a half-written output where the
//! game or the user could pick it up. A run that deploys checks, before any export is read, that
//! it can install into the PES folder's `download/`, and installs its CPKs there by a copy and
//! renames, all of them or none.
