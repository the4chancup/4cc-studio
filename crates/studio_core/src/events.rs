//! Pipeline events: what a tool's pipeline reports while it runs, and the structured findings
//! (`Message`) every tool emits instead of printing text.
//!
//! The CLI prints events as console lines; the GUI turns them into grid cells and log lines. Every
//! event travels in a `PipelineEventEnvelope`, whose run and revision ids let the GUI drop results
//! from a run or a filesystem snapshot that is no longer current (core plan, "Event system").
//!
//! `EventLines` is the console's line format (core plan, "Event system", "CLI translates
//! events"), used by the `studio` binary's printer and by a tool's plain run log, so a finding
//! reads the same in the terminal and in the window.
