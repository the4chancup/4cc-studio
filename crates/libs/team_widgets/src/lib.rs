//! `team_widgets`: the egui widgets the Save editor and the Team creator both
//! draw over `pes_savefile`'s model types. They live in a lib because a tool
//! crate never depends on another tool crate. A widget takes `&mut` model,
//! the version's schema for gating and the AATF rules where it shows limits;
//! it draws and it returns what changed, so the host decides what an edit
//! means. It never sees a session, an undo stack, a file, or a savefile
//! byte.

/// The card pickers: the skills grid and COM playing styles with a
/// remaining-count badge per ruleset tier, and the playing-style combo.
