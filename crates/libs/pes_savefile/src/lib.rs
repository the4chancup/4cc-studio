//! The PES EDIT savefile (`EDIT00000000`, `EDIT.bin` on PES 15): the per-version container
//! crypto for PES 15-21, the schema-driven player/team/tactics codec over the decrypted
//! payload, `EditFile` (the loaded file that rewrites itself byte-exact), and savefile
//! discovery.

//! Layers, bytes upward: `container` (bytes <-> decrypted sections, knows nothing about
//! players), `schema` + `codec` (sections <-> fields, knows nothing about encryption),
//! `model` (what consumers edit, no I/O and no version), `discovery` (where the file lives),
//! and `file` (`EditFile`, the only module that composes container and codec).
