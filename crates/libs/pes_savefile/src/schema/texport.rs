//! The Texport layout tables. Two eras: the 18-21 `.ted` (a 0x50 header, a
//! 32-byte XOR key at 0x30, then the save's own records concatenated) and the
//! 15-17 `TEXPORT00000000` (a whole savefile container; the table names where
//! the team, roster, tactics and player records sit in its payload).
//!
//! Provenance: the 18-21 constants are measured on real files: four 18,
//! eleven 19, one 20 and five 21 texports. The 15-17 layout is measured on all 46 texports of the
//! reference machine (12 PES 16, 34 17; PES 15's is PES 16's, unverified).
