//! `aatf`: the 4cc player rules (the community's "Auto-ATF" check). A
//! ruleset is **data** — one Rhai map naming the tiers, the card economy,
//! the heights and a list of conditional "specials" — read here into
//! `Ruleset` and checked against the rules the types cannot carry. A
//! `Rules` loads a whole rules file (steps 1 to 3 of "Loading and
//! validation": shape, `RULESET`, `check_team` on the sample team) and
//! runs its `check_team` on a `TeamView`, which a save or a Team TOML
//! document builds; a file knows its `logic()` identity. The shipped
//! logic (`logic/logic.rhai`) is the generic interpreter: `check_team`,
//! `tier_values` (behind `apply_tier`, the one writing operation) and
//! `card_limits`.
//!
//! The host reads a team as a `TeamView` of `PlayerView`s on the game's
//! own scale, and every script runs on the one engine of `engine.rs`.
//! The script API a ruleset sees, on `Player`: `slot`, `age`, `height`,
//! `weight`; `form`, `injury_resistance`, `weak_foot_usage`,
//! `weak_foot_accuracy` (the game's scale); `position`, `playing_style`,
//! `name_color` (label or `()`), `strong_foot` (`"right"` or `"left"`,
//! `()` past them); `cards` (the held skills and COM styles'
//! labels); `stat(name)` (the ability stat's value, `()` where the
//! version lacks it; an unknown name is a script error);
//! `rating_at(pos)` (`"A"`, `"B"` or `"C"`; a stored 3, which no save
//! holds, reads `"3"`; an unknown position is a script error).
//! On `Team`: `players` (the roster in slot order), `captain` (the slot,
//! `()` for none), `version` (the short number);
//! `fielded_positions(player, preset)` (labels, once each, in the
//! position table's order, empty for a player outside the starting
//! eleven; a preset outside 1 to 3 is a script error),
//! `fielded_only_at(player, pos)` (whether every formation the game can
//! field from the three presets fields the player at `pos`; for a player
//! outside the starting eleven, whether `pos` is his registered
//! position; an unknown position is a script error),
//! `formation(preset, formation)` (the eleven slots as
//! `#{ slot, position, x, y }`, `()` for a formation the preset cannot
//! field), `formation_shapes()` (`#{ preset, formation,
//! shape: [defenders, midfielders, forwards] }`); `man_marking` (whether
//! any preset has a man-marking assignment set), `auto_substitution`
//! (the stored setting, 0 off), `auto_offside_trap`,
//! `auto_preset_change`, `auto_attack_defence_levels` (the flag), each
//! auto value `()` on a version without it.
