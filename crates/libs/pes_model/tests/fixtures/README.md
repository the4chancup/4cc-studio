# pes_model fixtures

Konami-derived files are Konami's, kept for interoperability (see the repository README). Konami
`.model` and `.mtl` files ship WESYS-wrapped (`wezlib`). The four `.model` files copied first are
stored unwrapped; every later one (`*.wesys.model`) is stored as shipped, wrapped, which is
smaller and exercises the unwrap path. `.mtl` files are stored unwrapped (they are XML). Counts
are from the layout census (`scripts/provenance/pes_model/model_census.py`; the numbers below are
the record it left). Header version 19 everywhere except `konami_shadow_win32` (17).

| File | Source (under PES 2017 `Data/`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `konami_card.model` | `dt32_win_files/common/character1/model/character/parts/referee/card.model` | 1 bone, 1 mesh (140 vertices, 156 faces), 1 material, bitangents, no annotation; 10144 bytes |
| `konami_card_red.mtl` | same folder, `card_red.mtl` | the referee card's material set |
| `konami_flag_close.wesys.model` | same folder, `flag_close.model` | 0 bones (section 0 holds one empty entry), 1 mesh (174 vertices, 210 faces), annotation type 1; 4383 bytes wrapped, 7520 unwrapped |
| `konami_modD_cap.model` + `.mtl` | `.../character/d/modD_cap.model`, `modD_cap.mtl` | 4 bones, 1 mesh (56 vertices, 78 faces), uv1, `quadFloat32` weights, annotation type 1; 6336 bytes |
| `konami_hair_d_win32.model` | `.../face/edithair/model/sh_WD/hair_d_win32.model` | 2 bones, 1 mesh (165 vertices, 242 faces), `doubleFloat32` weights, annotation types 1 and 10; 11648 bytes |
| `konami_shadow_win32.wesys.model` + `konami_shadow.mtl` | `.../character/shadow/shadow_win32.model`, `shadow.mtl` | **version 17 layout**: 20-byte mesh records (no editor-data pointer), two per-mesh extras (no order word), 12-byte section-10 records; 19 bones, 1 mesh (position, normal, uv0 only; 2301 face vertices), no annotation; 7938 wrapped, 16928 unwrapped |
| `konami_glasses_02.wesys.model` + `konami_accessory.mtl` | `.../character/accessory/glasses_02.model`, `accessory.mtl` | 2 meshes, 2 materials, 2 bone groups over 1 bone, one annotation string used by both meshes (types 1 and 10 each), 2 section-3 records; 12118 wrapped, 27936 unwrapped |
| `konami_headHi.wesys.model` + `konami_headHi.mtl` | `.../face/common/headHi.model`, `headHi.mtl` | 4 bones, 1 mesh (341 vertices), annotation types 1 (`head_color`) and 7 (`HeadNormal`); 19339 wrapped, 30528 unwrapped |
| `konami_taping.wesys.model` | `.../character/accessory/taping.model` (`accessory.mtl` above is its material set) | `tripleFloat32` bone weights; 19394 wrapped, 37264 unwrapped |
| `konami_hair_high_sp_ty004.wesys.model` + `konami_hair.mtl` | `.../face/edithair/model/sp_ty004/hair_high_win32.model`, `hair.mtl` | vertex colors (`quadFloat8`), 2 meshes, 2 materials; 41388 wrapped, 64864 unwrapped |
| `konami_collar_052.wesys.model` | `dt35_win_files/common/character0/model/character/d/modD_shirt_tight_in_collar_052.model` | **6 LOD levels** (face ranges 0-12240, -21510, -28353, -33231, -36510, -38496; section 7 LOD record `6, 0.0625, 4.0, 0.3`), 23 bones, 2646 vertices, annotation types 1 (`prt`), 2 (`DSpecularS`), 7 (`DNormalS`); the largest fixture at 148672 wrapped, 280848 unwrapped, kept because no smaller Konami file carries a LOD table |
| `konami_collar_001.wesys.model` | `dt35_win_files/common/character0/model/character/uniform/nocloth/collar_001.model` (PES 2017's stock collar 1, read with the game's shared `uniform.mtl`) | 12 bones, 2 meshes (97 vertices and 122 faces on `uni_shirts`, 278 and 442 on `uni_collar`), materials in that order, no annotation; 24232 wrapped, 37072 unwrapped. The Team compiler's collar tests convert it: posed off PES 15's skeleton, byte for byte on PES 16 and 17 |
| `cardhead_face_high.model` + `cardhead_materials.mtl` | the community pre-Fox card-head template (`Models/Templates_prefox/card head`), add-on written | 1 bone, 1 mesh (16 vertices, 8 faces), material `card`, shader `Shadeless`, annotation types 128 (mesh name) and 129 (extension header); add-on section order; 1936 bytes |
| `cardhead_doublesided_face_high.model` | `.../card head doublesided/face_high.model` (its `materials.mtl` is byte-identical to the one above) | 1 bone, 1 mesh (8 vertices, 4 faces); 1400 bytes |
| `community_tail_data_hair_d.wesys.model` | a community referee hair (`4cc refs compiler Beta/refs_to_add_ll/blaster/hair_d_win32.model`), writer unknown | **data past its section**: the geometry's vertex-field and face offsets (relative to section 1's start, as always) land after section 7, the last section in file order, while section 1's own run holds an unreferenced face stream; 1 mesh (171 vertices, 246 faces), material `modD_phone`, annotation types 1 and 10 on string `nld0027_d`; 8429 wrapped, 18828 unwrapped. One of 1640 community files in the 2026-09-28 census that failed with `Truncated` before the typed reader resolved offsets against the whole file. Its stored mesh box is the stale one too (it does not contain the vertices), carried as read |
| `community_template_annotation_ad.wesys.model` | a community stadium ad board (`Teams_Main/JP/Stadium/.../st023/model/ad_center1_el.model`), writer unknown | **unresolvable annotation**: its one annotation carries the constant pointers `-124`/`-84` (word 8, kind 1) that this writer puts in every annotation of every file, here landing inside section 1; section 2's one string is the four bytes `05 14 02 05`, referenced by nothing; 1 mesh (3 vertices, 1 face), material `empty`; 324 wrapped, 942 unwrapped. One of 228 census files with such annotations |
| `community_empty_geometry_boots.wesys.model` | a community boots template (`4cc-aet-compiler-blue/lib/templates/refscpk_prefox/.../boots/k0062/boots.model`) | **zero-vertex geometries**: both geometries declare 0 vertices and 0 face indices, with every field and face offset pointing at or past the end of the file (a zero-length read there); 42080 wrapped, 76144 unwrapped. One of the census files that failed with `Truncated` after the whole-file fix |
| `community_duplicate_field_flat_player.wesys.model` | the community flat-player template (`Models/Templates_prefox/Flat player template - anime shading doublesided/oral_2dplayer_win32.model`) | **a field type listed twice**: geometry 0 (8 vertices) carries a second bone-weights descriptor (4 vertices, offset 37472, inside the first one's data) after the real one; the first descriptor of a type is the field; 23972 wrapped, 38604 unwrapped. One of 4 census files |
| `community_loose_vertex_hair.wesys.model` | a cup export's hair (`Teams_Main/JP/nijiura/NIJIURA JP Aesthetic Export/Faces/89420/hair_high_win32.model`) | **indices shifted past loose vertices**: geometry 2 (1058 vertices, 6018 face indices) uses 1058 distinct indices with maximum 1058, one value below it unused (an old exporter counted loose vertices it did not write); geometries 0 and 1 are clean; 191474 wrapped, 312148 unwrapped. One of 4 census files meeting the repair condition (a fifth, with indices up to 65428, does not) |

Community `.mtl` representatives from the 2026-09-28 `.mtl` census, each one of its class:

| File | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `community_maxfilter.mtl` | a Winter 26 cup export (`4CCTANGIBLES/Faces/XXX01 - Nose/materials.mtl`) | samplers with a `maxfilter` attribute between `minfilter` and `magfilter`; 4582 bytes; one of 3 |
| `community_second_close_tag.mtl` | `Teams_Guest/h/72219 - Faceless/hands.mtl` | a second `</materialset>` after the root; 1863 bytes; one of 6 |
| `community_trailing_junk.mtl` | `Teams_Guest/bird/0Faces/88902 - USA/face.mtl` | binary bytes after the root; 421 bytes; one of 2 |

The `.mtl` files differ in whitespace between Konami folders (`konami_shadow.mtl` and
`konami_accessory.mtl` are CRLF with tabs, `konami_headHi.mtl` LF with tabs, `konami_hair.mtl`
CRLF with four-space indents), so `.mtl` byte parity is per file, not one canonical formatting.

The reference writer cannot rebuild any parsed file (it expects a bounding box the importer sets),
so there is no legacy read-then-write parity to reproduce; the standard is our own reader/writer,
as for `fmdl`.
