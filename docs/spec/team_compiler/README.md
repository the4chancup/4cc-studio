# 4cc Studio — Team compiler plan

The Team compiler (`crates/tools/team_compiler`) is the flagship tool of the suite:
the successor to the AET Compiler (Red/Blue). It compiles aesthetics exports into CPK
archives, with compile-time model format conversion (see the
[Model conversion plan](../model_conversion/README.md)) and compile-time aesthetics (on Fox the
output CPK's database tables and the savefile patch; the pre-Fox savefile writing is still
planned — see the [Savefile plan](../pes_savefile/README.md)). Platform context (crate structure, tool
plugin trait, GUI shell, parallelism) is in the [core plan](../core/README.md).

### Relationship to the older compilers

The older compilers are stopgaps, not templates. The original batch-file compiler
was rudimentary; **Red** is a direct translation of it into Python — feature-complete
and battle-tested, but slow at its core (it works by moving files around on
storage); **Blue** is an LLM-made prototype demonstrating that an in-memory,
parallel pipeline is possible. None of them is followed to the letter:

- **The contract is output parity with Red** (still the golden standard): given the
  same inputs, the game-facing CPK contents must match Red's — exact bytes for
  unaffected artifacts and normalized semantic parity for intentional ID/path/layout
  changes (see `testing.md` "Testing: parity against Red"). *How* that output
  is produced is free to change.
- **The implementation is built around the object model** (typed structs
  representing each element of an export — see the [Aesthetics export plan](../aesthetics_export/README.md)), not around Red's
  disk-shuffling stages or Blue's path-string processing functions. References to
  Red/Blue modules in this document identify *where the behavior to reproduce is
  specified*, not code to translate.
- **Warning/error messaging is overhauled**, not ported: the pipeline emits
  structured `PipelineEvent`s (see the core plan) carrying export/folder identity,
  and the GUI/CLI decide presentation. Red's console-text messages serve only as a
  checklist of conditions worth reporting.

The plan is split into parts; section headings are unchanged from the
single-file plan.

| Part | Covers |
|---|---|
| [Pipeline](pipeline.md) | Per-export pipeline walkthrough |
| [Message catalog](messages.md) | Message catalog |
| [Settings](settings.md) | Settings |
| [Blue features to port](blue_port.md) | Unimplemented Blue Features to Port |
| [GUI grid](../../plans/team_compiler/gui.md) | GUI: the live-validating team grid; Live validation (no Check or Refresh buttons); Cell states; Toolbar |
| [Testing](testing.md) | Testing: parity against Red (adapted from Blue) |

## Crate layout

One crate, organized by **pipeline stage**, so a reader who knows the walkthrough below knows where
the code is. The layout is fixed here because the crate is large (~88k lines) and largely
LLM-written: a predefined tree is what keeps generated code from scattering into `utils.rs` piles
and re-inventing placement per session.

```

Placement rules:

- **If it validates an export, it is not here** — it belongs in `libs/aesthetics_export`.
- **If two tools need it, it is not here** — it moves to a lib (`pipeline` for scaffolding such as
  `MemoryBudget` and `CpkStem`; `aesthetics_export` for format knowledge). The same rule
  in reverse: `bins/dpfl.rs` stays here until a second consumer appears (the Balls compiler only
  *checks* the DPFL, via a read helper that can move to `pipeline` when needed).
- **`processing/materialize.rs` is the single output-mode seam.** No task's output asks which
  output mode is active; the mode decides only *where bytes go* — `compile` picks the
  `OutputSink`, the promotion target and whether `overrides/` applies, `output/` writes through
  them — never *what a task produces*.
- **`reader/` is the only module that touches export sources.** `check`/`compile` ask it for the
  current export set; `plan/` receives the resolved exports and `processing/` the files a task
  read through `ContentSource`; nothing else opens a folder or archive.
- **`view/` is render-only.** It reads tool state built from `PipelineEvent`s and emits the user
  intent (compile); it never calls into `processing/` or `output/` directly.
- **Module names follow the walkthrough's stage names** (`reader`, `check`, `plan`, `processing`,
  `bins`, `output`) so the plan and the tree use one vocabulary. `pipeline` is deliberately *not*
  used for a tool-local module: it is the shared lib's name, and `pipeline::MemoryBudget` next to a
  `crate::pipeline::…` would be a permanent source of confusion.
- **Files, not folders, until a module exceeds roughly a thousand lines** — then it becomes a
  folder with a `mod.rs` and the same name, so paths in this plan stay valid.
- No `utils.rs`, `helpers.rs`, or `misc.rs`. A helper belongs to the stage that uses it; one used by
  several stages belongs to `pipeline`.

## Object model and export format

The export object model, its validation progression (`ParsedAestheticsExport` → `ValidatedAestheticsExport` →
`ResolvedAestheticsExport`), the `aesthetics_export` crate layout, the player-folder format, `settings.toml` in
exports, and the FPC marker files are specified in the [Aesthetics export plan](../aesthetics_export/README.md). The
compiler consumes them; only the compile-time behavior — the loaded processing types
(`ModelFolder` and friends, with their conversion and packing methods), the `BuildManifest`,
planning, processing, packing, bins, GUI, and CLI — lives in this crate and this plan.

---

## Development phases

- **Phase 3 — skeleton and shared export model (done 2026-10-02):** `libs/aesthetics_export`'s
  structure parsing and format-level validation (on the `ExportIdentity` boundary, the sanitized
  validated-versus-eligible projection and the roster-entry semantics of "Validation semantics"
  in the [Aesthetics export plan](../aesthetics_export/object_model.md)), the Team compiler
  settings/CLI surface, the reader/coordinator/writer over `libs/pipeline` compiling the subset
  in "Phase 3 scope" below, and the shell slice's view.
- **Phase 4 — processing logic (done 2026-10-12):** the deep pass, model and non-model
  processing on both engines (cross-format conversion through the Phase 2 `model_convert`),
  packing, bins, referees, the
  output modes and deployment, on synthetic Studio-format fixtures, with planning fixing every
  output name and every model task's planned IDs before processing; what `compile` builds is
  "Phase 4 scope" below. Its parity with Red covers the tracer export (Fox) and the pre-Fox
  reference (`testing.md`); the full Red parity gate over upgraded old exports depends on
  Phase 6's Export upgrader (and on Phase 5's savefile and ID integration), so it runs once
  those phases land.
- **Phase 5 — savefile integration (done 2026-10-16):** on Fox, every compiled player's
  `PlayerAppearance.bin`, `BootsList.bin` and `GloveList.bin` rows from his resolved
  `settings.toml`, the default-ID rows, the Midcup shared-IDs record, and the aesthetics patch,
  written beside the output and applied to the local save in one transaction with the CPKs;
  what `compile` builds is "Phase 5 scope" below. The pre-Fox patch is deferred with
  pre-Fox's other gaps.

This documents the dependency without changing the phase order in the core plan.

---

## Acceptance

Format and rules: `CONTRIBUTING.md` "Testing". IDs are never reused; later phases append.
In every phase's scenarios, a team export is a `Full` export, its name carrying the tag,
unless the scenario says `Midcup` (the Aesthetics export plan's "Coverage tag"), and a
scenario that names no PES version runs for PES 21. A GIVEN names the files that decide its
outcome; a folder or export it names also holds the least ordinary content its THEN needs
to be reachable (a face model in a player folder whose face compiles, a model in a shared
folder, a `kit.dds` in a kit whose texture is used, a kit in an export whose bin entries
are observed), as the cited test sets up.

**Phase 3 scope.** Phase 3 delivered discovery and export sources, `aesthetics_export`'s
structure pass with its dispositions ("Validation semantics" in the Aesthetics export plan),
export identity, the settings and CLI surface, the pipeline scaffolding compiling the tracer
bullet's content (Fox player folders with face models, and kits) into a CPK, and the shell
slice. Until step 4.20 a subset gate skipped, with the Error `content_not_yet_compiled`, every
export holding anything `compile` could not build yet, so that no CPK differing from the
finished compiler's was written; the gate is withdrawn with its finding (TC-OUT-06), and every
export of either engine reaches processing whatever it holds. What becomes of a file is its
role's: a file no package reads is not read and is reported `file_not_used` (`pipeline.md`
"2. Per-export serial steps", the face-file paragraph), the one refusal left being a model
folder whose selected representation is glTF (`model_gltf_unsupported`, Phase 7). A refs export
plans no colors record (its `colors.txt` is not read), no `team_colors_missing`, no kits and no
`BootsList.bin`/`GloveList.bin` rows: the game's referee hook loads slot NN's `k99NN`/`g99NN`
by number, and the referees' kits are the template tree's (`blue_port.md` "Referee export
processing"), so a refs export's kits, logo, portraits and collars are `file_not_used`.
Findings are observed
in `check`'s and `compile`'s console output, one line per finding naming its code and scope; the
compiled CPK's content is the parity test's (`testing.md`), not a scenario's. Of the events,
Phase 3 emits `ExportStarted`, `Message` and `ExportProcessed` only: `FolderStatus`, `Progress`
and `Complete` wait for their consumers, the progress grid and the run strip (Phase 8), which
is also when `Complete`'s placeholder fields are restructured ("Event system" in
`core/architecture.md`), so a cell's outcome (`DoneWithErrors`, "Cell states" in `gui.md`) is
not one of these scenarios.

**Shell slice**

```
TC-GUI-01  manual  GIVEN the studio binary
                   WHEN it is launched with no arguments
                   THEN a window titled 4cc Studio opens, whose sidebar lists the registered tools
TC-GUI-02  GIVEN the tracer bullet's export in the exports folder
           WHEN Compile is clicked
           THEN the run is the CLI's `compile` on the effective settings (what it writes and
                where is TC-DEP's and TC-OUT's), and the log shows the run's findings as the
                console prints them (the export's export_identified line among them), then the
                run's exit code
TC-GUI-03  GIVEN the shell with registered tools
           WHEN a tool's sidebar entry is clicked
           THEN that entry is marked active and its view is the one drawn; the Team compiler's
                view shows its settings section, collapsed, opening on the effective settings
                as `key = value` lines, a Compile button enabled while no run is in flight and
                disabled while one is, and the run log, which follows its newest line
```

Only the first needs a display (`run_gui` opens the window); the rest of the Phase 3 slice is
proven headless (`egui::Context::run_ui`, the frame's AccessKit nodes).

**Phase 4 scope.** `compile` builds everything a validated export holds, for every target version
(PES 15-21) and for referee exports, into the normal CPK, the test tree or the sideload tree, and
deploys the CPKs into the PES install, degrading to `output/` when it cannot; `check` runs the
structure pass and the deep pass on every source kind. The run plans IDs (the 40-ID blocks;
`duplicate_aesthetics_export` is the validation pass's, `duplicate_path` the writer's), reads the
working bins from the installed CPKs and writes `UniColor.bin` and `TeamColor.bin` and, on Fox,
`UniformParameter.bin` and the `BootsList.bin` and `GloveList.bin` rows for the compiled players whose custom boots or gloves
committed, a failed output keeping the installed row, a compiled player of a `Full`
export whose folder holds no boots or no gloves losing that installed row, every other row kept,
`PlayerAppearance.bin` passing through unchanged until Phase 5
builds its rows from `settings.toml`. `content_not_yet_compiled` is withdrawn (step 4.20). What
`compile` still refuses: a model folder whose selected representation is glTF, dropped with
`model_gltf_unsupported` until Phase 7, never compiled from a native source beside it. Not in
Phase 4, so not here: the savefile step and the aesthetics patch (Phase 5; `compile` emits no
`savefile_*` or `patch_written` finding and a configured savefile is left byte-identical),
`run_pes`, `FolderStatus`/`Progress`/`Complete`, live validation and the GUI's degraded-run
actions (Phase 8), the in-game effect of a `GloveList.bin` row (FoxDen's gloves patch, worklog
"Issues") and of a sideload tree (FoxDen's LiveCPK gaps). The areas `PRT`, `MOD`, `TEX`, `CHK`,
`XML`, `CMN`, `BIN`, `PLN`, `REF` and `DEP` are new; `KIT`, `ROOT` and `OUT` continue their
numbering. Scenarios observe the console findings, the exit code, the files of the output tree or
of the CPK (read back with the `cpk` crate); byte parity with Red is the parity test's. Test
data: `/co/` is team 714, so its 40-ID block is 621-660, slot 05 is player 71405 with exclusive
boots/gloves ID 625 and the first shared ID is 644; `/egg/` is 792 (the tracer fixture); `/a/` is
702 and `/b/` 707.

TC-MOD-59  GIVEN Faces/Round holding fcl_hair.fmdl and boots.fmdl, Boots/Crocs holding boots.fmdl,
           slot 05 holding no model and linking both (Round.face, Crocs.boots)
           WHEN the export is compiled for PES 21
           THEN link_combined is reported for both links, the boots folder of slot 05's exclusive

                shared boots folder is written for Crocs
TC-MOD-60  GIVEN slot 05 holding a hand-weighted face model and Crocs.gloves, Gloves/Crocs holding
           glove_l.fmdl and glove_r.fmdl
           WHEN the export is compiled for PES 21

           under one name, letter case aside
           WHEN the export is compiled for PES 17
           THEN folder_pack_failed names the folder (Common, for files of Common/) and the name,
                and that folder's package is left out (for Common/, its models and .mtl files,
                its textures standing) while the rest of the export compiles
TC-MOD-85  GIVEN an FMDL that a PES 15-17 output reads (the tracer's fcl_hair.fmdl with its .skl),
           in a subfolder of slot 05, a shared folder he links, Common/ through a .common
           link, or among an ingame_face player's boots or gloves parts
           WHEN the export is compiled for PES 17
           THEN it is converted into a .model and .mtl written where a .model of its name there

                boots.skl is Kit_Boots.skl
TC-MOD-87  GIVEN slot 05's face parts defining one material over textures in two places:
           torso.fmdl beside his shirt.dds, and torso2.fmdl.common linking the same model
           in Common/ beside Common/shirt.dds
           WHEN the export is compiled for PES 21

TC-MOD-89  GIVEN slot 05 holding boots.model with its .mtl, one of whose bones no game
           skeleton holds
           WHEN the export is compiled for PES 21
           THEN the boots package's boots.skl holds that bone; beside a boots.skl of his

           Common/env.dds), or templates/env.dds in the data directory
           WHEN the export is compiled for PES 17
           THEN the EnvironmentMap names that env.dds and the CPK's env.dds is that texture,
                not the bundled template's; the data directory's reports
                template_override_active
TC-MOD-91  GIVEN slot 05 holding an FMDL one of whose textures has the directory

                CPKs are byte-identical
TC-TEX-09  GIVEN slot 05 holding a face model naming the textures hair and skin, skin.dds,
           hair.dds.common, and Common/hair.dds
           WHEN the export is compiled for PES 21 (or PES 17)

           one, which only conversion refuses, beside a sound Common/skin.dds)
           WHEN each export is compiled for PES 21
           THEN the first reports texture_too_small and link_target_dropped and slot 05 is left

TC-TEX-13  GIVEN slot 05 holding no model and an env.dds that is a 128x128 DXT5 cube map with
           eight mip levels (the bundled template's bytes); the textures task reads no model,

                entry, then the entry a generated xml gives hair.model, then the face_neck
                dummy; a file of his at a path a shared entry names (his face_diff for the <dif>)

                model and .mtl is packed under its own name, his own among a linked set's, and
                the set is completed against the export's kits as a generated entry's is

TC-DEP-16  GIVEN no PES folder or no download/, a DpFileList.bin that cannot be read, or a CPK to
           rename held open without delete sharing

```

**Phase 5 scope.** On Fox, `compile` builds every compiled player's `PlayerAppearance.bin` row
from his `settings.toml` and folder markers, writes the boots and gloves rows of every compiled
player (the default-ID rows included), and writes the aesthetics patch (motions, and a `write_names`
export's names) to the output folder, applying it to the local savefile. A compiled player is
every player a kept player folder of a team export maps to ("Player settings in exports" in the Aesthetics export
plan). Phase 5 withdraws TC-BIN-10, TC-BIN-17 and TC-BIN-22, whose player tables it changes,
and TC-BIN-25 to TC-BIN-27 restate them. Not in Phase 5, so not here: the pre-Fox patch and its
savefile writes (deferred with pre-Fox's other gaps: a compile for PES 15-17 writes no patch and
leaves the savefile byte-identical) and a referee export's settings (worklog issue). PES 18
and 19 appearance rows are built like PES 20 and 21's (`spec/pes_savefile/model.md`, "The Fox
database row"). Test data as in Phase 4. A scenario naming no coverage tag compiles a `Full`
export (a `Midcup` one keeps a player's installed row where a `Full` one writes the default,
`aesthetics_export/settings_toml.md`). The patch halves of TC-BIN-31 to TC-BIN-33 are proven
with the patch (step 5.3b), their table halves before. Unless a
scenario says otherwise, the PES folder is a deployable fixture install whose DpFileList lists
`4cc_08_bins` (holding the three player tables) and the output CPK, and `savefile_path` names
a stripped fixture save of the compile's version carrying team 714 (a test never uses `auto`,
which would find the developer's own save).

**Player tables**

           and the fpc_off marker
           WHEN it is compiled for PES 21 as a Full export, then as a Midcup export
           THEN the Full run's BootsList.bin holds (71405, 625), (71406, 0) and (71407, 0), and

                /co/ export holding Boots/Birk and Boots/crocs, slots 05 and 07 linking Birk and
                slot 06 alone linking crocs
           WHEN it is compiled for PES 21
           THEN Birk takes 646 and crocs keeps 645, the record naming it though one player
                wears it: BootsList.bin holds (71405, 646), (71406, 645) and (71407, 646), the
                CPK's record names 644 adidas, 645 crocs and 646 Birk, and no
                shared_ids_unrecorded is reported
TC-BIN-36  GIVEN no installed CPK holding a /co/ record, and a Midcup /co/ export holding
                Boots/Birk, slots 05 and 06 linking it; and, apart, the same Midcup with slot 05
                alone linking Birk
           WHEN each is compiled for PES 21
           THEN the first's Birk takes 644, BootsList.bin holds (71405, 644) and (71406, 644),
                shared_ids_unrecorded names team 714, and the CPK's record names 644 Birk; the
                second's Birk takes 625, slot 05's own ID, and the CPK holds no record and
                reports no shared_ids_unrecorded
TC-BIN-39  GIVEN no installed CPK holding a /co/ record, and a Midcup /co/ export whose only
                player folder, slot 05, holds a settings.toml
           WHEN it is compiled for PES 21
           THEN the CPK holds no 4cc_studio/shared_ids/714.toml, and no shared_ids_unrecorded
                is reported
TC-BIN-40  GIVEN an installed CPK below the output holding an empty /co/ record, and TC-BIN-39's
                Midcup export; and, apart, a Full /co/ export whose only player folder, slot
                05, holds a settings.toml
           WHEN each is compiled for PES 21
           THEN each CPK holds 4cc_studio/shared_ids/714.toml with no entry, and no
                shared_ids_unrecorded is reported
TC-BIN-41  GIVEN four /co/ exports whose slot 05 settings.toml sets the stock ID 3 (gloves_id
                in the first two, boots_id in the others): the first's slot 05 holding
                Crocs.gloves, the export's Gloves/Crocs/ holding glove_l.fmdl; the second's a
                body.fmdl whose vertices carry both hands' weights; the third's Round.face, the
                export's Faces/Round/
                holding face_high.fmdl and boots.fmdl; the fourth's Crocs.boots, the export's
                Boots/Crocs/ holding a texture and no model
           WHEN each is checked and compiled for PES 21
           THEN 71405's GloveList.bin row is 625, his exclusive ID, in the first (Crocs, which
                he alone wears) and in the second (the hands split off his body), and his
                BootsList.bin row 625 in the third (Round's boots.fmdl a part of his boots),
                each run reporting settings_model_id_conflict for the authored key; the
                fourth's row is the authored 3, shared_folder_no_model names Boots/Crocs, and
                no settings_model_id_conflict is reported
TC-BIN-42  GIVEN the installed game holding team 714's TeamColor.bin and UniColor.bin entries
           for p1 to p3, and two Midcup /co/ exports, the first holding a root colors.txt and
           an empty Kits/p2/ (a root file alone is export_empty), the second only
           Kits/p2/colors.txt
           WHEN each is compiled for PES 21
           THEN each writes the output CPK: the first's TeamColor.bin holds the root file's
                colors for 714, the second's UniColor.bin p2's colors with p1 and p3 as
                installed
```

**Shared gloves on PES 15-17**

Every `.mtl` of the output moves to its root (`pipeline.md` "3. Per-model-folder parallel
steps (rayon)"), so TC-MOD-93 restates TC-MOD-74, whose packing it changes; TC-MOD-74 is
marked withdrawn in the commit that rewires its test.

```
TC-MOD-93  GIVEN Gloves/Keeper holding glove_l.model with glove_l.mtl, skin.dds, and
                grip/glove_r.model with grip/glove_r.mtl naming grip.dds and skin.dds, and
                grip/grip.dds, slot 05 linking it
           WHEN the export is compiled for PES 17
           THEN the gloves output holds grip/glove_r.model, grip_glove_r.mtl, grip/grip.dds
                and skin.dds, and no grip/glove_r.mtl; glove.xml lists ./glove_l.model and
                ./grip/glove_r.model with material ./grip_glove_r.mtl; grip_glove_r.mtl's
                paths name ./grip/grip.dds and ./skin.dds
```

**Referees**

```
TC-REF-19  GIVEN a refs export whose Ref A holds a face model and a settings.toml setting the
                gloves checkbox on and no gloves; and a refs export whose Ref A, with the same
                settings.toml, links Grip.gloves, the export's Gloves/Grip/ holding glove_l.fmdl
           WHEN each is checked, and compiled for PES 21
           THEN both runs of the first report fpc_gloves_checkbox_winter_gloves for Ref A; the
                CPK holds no PlayerAppearance.bin row for him, and no patch is written; the
                second reports no gloves finding (the linked gloves are his own package)
