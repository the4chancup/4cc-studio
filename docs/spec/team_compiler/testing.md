# 4cc Studio — Team compiler plan: Testing

Part of the [Team compiler plan](README.md). Section headings are unchanged from the single-file plan, so an existing pointer to a section still names it; only the file part of the pointer changed.

## Testing: parity against Red (adapted from Blue)

Blue has `test_parity.py` that runs the full pipeline, compares ordinary leaf files byte-for-byte,
and compares nested CPKs by entry equivalence so container timestamp differences are accepted.
The Rust test expands Blue's comparison into the four tiers below.

```text
cargo test -p team_compiler --test parity
```

The parity harness supplies the reference-fixture location; it is not a custom `--reference` flag
passed through to Rust's standard test harness, which does not accept that option.

The reference tree is the **extracted contents** of Red's output CPK (Blue's `Singlecpk_files`
convention) — Red itself emits `patches_output/{cpk_name}.cpk`, so the fixture is produced by a
one-time extraction step. A reference tree small enough to commit is
committed as the tree itself: the tracer bullet's (`tests/fixtures/tracer/red/`, under
1 MB) and the pre-Fox tracer's (`tests/fixtures/tracer_prefox/red/`, PES 2017, about 660 KB) run
their parity cases anywhere, CI included, without Red.

Each tracer has two cases: its hand-made Studio twin (`studio/`), and the Export upgrader's own
output for the old export (`upgraded/`, a golden: tool crates never depend on each other, so
`export_upgrader`'s `tests/upgraded_golden.rs` checks that upgrading `old/` still gives exactly
that tree, and the parity case compiles it). The upgraded case compiles the golden under the
twin's `Midcup` tag: the upgrader tags it `Full`, and a `Full` export missing a player kit gets
the compiler's placeholder kit, which the tracers' one-kit cut would add to the comparison
without telling anything about parity. Its expected differences from the twin's case are what
the member's own `face.xml`, which the upgrader keeps, decides on pre-Fox: the face model packed
under the name it lists, its entries as the member wrote them, and its `boots` typing's warning.

Intentional differences must be accounted for:

- **Auto-assigned boots/gloves IDs** may differ from the old embedded IDs — the comparison
  normalizes ID-dependent paths and embedded references.
- **Texture locations**: every player's textures are relocated to per-player common subfolders (see
  "Texture relocation to common" in the walkthrough), where Red packs an AET-layout export's
  textures inside each model folder's structure and relocates a Pre-Studio (`Players/`) export's
  to `common/<team>/<name part>/`, keyed by the folder name without its number prefix; textures resolved from `Common/` stay in the team's Common output and
  are referenced in place. The comparison matches textures by content across locations and verifies
  that rewritten references resolve to the relocated files (`check_resolved`); that a Common
  texture appears once in the archive however many players reference it is
  `tests/cli/common_links.rs`'s check, the tracers holding no `Common/`.
- **Automatic collar reconciliation**: unlike Red's pass-through behavior, the compiler derives the
  custom collar ID from the `collar_[ID]` filename and rewrites the team's kit configs;
  `tests/cli/collars.rs` verifies those config-field changes, the tracers carrying no collar.
- **Dropped features** (Other folder) are excluded.
- **Kit-dependent path magic**: Red emits the legacy `u0XXXp0`/`u0XXXp1`… spelling (with the `XXX`
  placeholder or a baked-in team ID, as the author wrote it), the compiler emits `kitN`/`kit1`…
  (see "Kit-dependent assets" in the [Unified model format plan](../model_format.md)). The
  compiler gets no switch to emit the legacy spelling: parity is a
  file-tree comparison, not an in-game test, and the exes can be modded to `kitN` at any time, so a
  switch would be a second output format maintained for nothing.

Comparison uses four tiers:

1. **Exact leaf bytes** for unaffected files such as DDS textures and raw bin outputs.
2. **Decoded and normalized comparison** for FMDL, MTL, XML, kit configs, and other ID/path-bearing
   content; generated IDs and relocated paths are normalized before remaining fields are compared.
   FTEX files are compared by their header fields (`ftex::info`, texture type included) and by
   the DDS each converts back to (`ftex::ftex_to_dds`), not by their own bytes: their mip data
   sits in zlib chunks, and a different deflate encoder writes
   different chunks for the same pixels (the `ftex` crate's stated non-goal). The tracer's two
   FTEX entries differ from Red's in exactly that way and convert back identically.
3. **Archive-entry equivalence** for CPK/FPK containers, whose container bytes may differ because of
   ordering metadata or timestamps while their normalized entries agree.
4. **An explicit intentional-difference allowlist** reviewed with the fixture, rather than broad
   exclusions that can hide regressions.

Maintain a versioned test matrix for PES 15–21 covering team and referee exports; folders, ZIP, and
7z; native and converted pre-Fox/Fox models; local, shared, and combined models; normal, multi-CPK,
test, and sideload modes; savefile success/failure and cancellation. Key behavior areas:

- **Rosters and identity**: an export stem such as `co - Spring.zip` resolving through `/co/`; a
  folder and archive with identical display stems staying distinct (including in test-mode output
  directories); referee identity never constructing a normal `TeamId`; duplicate folder-name slots
  vs duplicate authoritative `players.txt` slots and their distinct dispositions; line-local
  malformed and out-of-range roster entries producing `DropSlot`; an empty/all-invalid referee
  roster blocked while an empty normal-team roster supports a kit-only export; a refs export without
  `players.txt` blocked by the compiler; multiple refs exports
  (valid or not) all blocked at discovery; team-ID resolution failure; duplicate team IDs;
  multi-mapped folders (team and referee) preparing once and instantiating per slot
  atomically, with textures emitted once into the name-keyed common subfolder shared by all mapped
  slots.
- **Models and textures**: target-native plus convertible model variants; each model source owned
  exactly once; a team player with boots/settings but no face; multiple same-category shared links
  rejected; both `ingame_face` spellings normalizing identically with a local pre-Fox boots
  composite still emitted; FMDL→pre-Fox conversion emitting an atomic `.model`+`.mtl` pair;
  shared-texture dedup and
  deterministic conflict resolution under reversed rayon completion; logo production (a 1000×600
  source under each fit mode yields the three square sizes; `logo_small` replaces only the 128²;
  an undecodable `logo_small` drops all three; a 300² source is upscaled and reported); kit
  folders (`p1 - Lakers` resolving to `p1` with the label kept; `p1/` beside `p1 - Lakers/`
  discarding both; `all/kit_back.dds` emitted under every kit's ID with each config's `back` field
  set, while a kit's own `kit_back.dds` wins for that kit only; the emitted files identical to a
  compile of the same export with the shared files copied into each kit folder; `all/config.toml`
  ignored with a warning; an empty `p3/` yielding the checkerboard texture, the mask template, the
  template config and a UniColor entry carrying the magenta/black pair, with `kit_placeholder`
  and `kit_colors_missing`; the same `p3/` with a `colors.txt` carrying its colors and no
  `kit_colors_missing`; a `p4/` holding only `kit_back.dds` yielding the same plus `_back` and a
  config whose `back` field is set; a kit with a real texture and no colors deriving from the
  texture, never reaching the loud pair); kit layout (a `pre-fox` kit compiled for PES 21: every
  texel outside the sock rectangles equal to the no-marker compile's, each sock stripe's centre
  within 6 px of the golden computed from the games' uniform models
  (`tests/fixtures/kit_layout/`), `kit_layout_converted` reported; the same kit compiled for PES 17 identical to the no-marker compile; a `fox` kit for
  PES 17 taking the inverse table, and pre-Fox→Fox→pre-Fox on a synthetic texture whose bands are
  flat colors round-tripping exactly; `_back`/`_leg`/`_name` untouched either way; both markers
  discarding the kit; a marker in `all/` warned and ignored; a placeholder kit with a marker
  compiling as without one); mask/srm (a kit with `kit_mask.dds` compiled for PES 21 emitting no
  `_mask` and no `_srm`, with `kit_texture_not_used`; the same kit for PES 17 emitting the mask
  as given; a kit with `kit_srm.dds` for PES 17 emitting the mask *template* and no srm; a kit
  with both emitting exactly the target's one, the other named by `kit_texture_not_used`); user `face.xml` (a hand-written xml
  compiled for PES 17 emitted with the team ID substituted and its unknown `type` and extra
  attribute kept verbatim, each with its warning, and `level="1"` kept with `xml_level_lod` as
  info; the same folder with the xml removed
  producing the generated xml, proving filename typing is off when one is present; a `<model>`
  without `path` and a `./` reference to an absent file each discarding the folder; a
  `model/character/face/common/…` path passing with `xml_path_unchecked`; a folder with a `<dif>`
  in the xml and a `face_diff.xml` beside it discarded; an xml lacking `face_neck` gaining the dummy
  entry; an unlisted `.model` reported and absent from the output; the same folder compiled for
  PES 21 ignoring the xml and converting the models); collar validation (`collar_[ID]` filename parsing, a cross-team
  `collar_id_conflict` resolving by canonical export order, and a custom collar overriding the FPC
  collar value in every config).
- **Planning and writer**: cross-export duplicate paths producing the same manifest under reversed
  completion order; override-versus-export collision resolution; nested-root path collisions;
  partial planning continuing valid teams after refs or duplicate-team drops; a plan with no
  eligible tasks producing no output or deployment; a structural `DropFolder` still yielding a
  compilable export; a late model-task failure leaving no entries from that task while successful
  sibling tasks may still commit; a failed kit never mutating UniColor/UniformParameter; notes from a rejected export excluded from
  `teamnotes.txt`; root colors/notes/referee-marker descriptors reaching planning; scope-dependent
  `source_read_failed` and `template_override_unreadable` outcomes; pass-through refusing
  conversion/packing/logo/texture-conflict findings and
  unsafe-path/ambiguous-roster/required-metadata findings.
- **Deployment and environment**: the installed ID kept for players whose boots/gloves task failed
  (Fox: the player's installed table row; pre-Fox: his savefile ID) while independent settings
  still apply; with either FPC marker, successful standalone assets
  overriding preset IDs, failed/dropped requested assets preserving existing IDs, and absent
  standalone assets using preset IDs (including pre-Fox face-XML-local parts); a mixed
  `fpc_on`/`fpc_off` team applying per-player presets; source modification after planning producing
  `source_changed_during_run` (no final output published, no installed CPK or savefile changed);
  separate refs CPK installation; multi-CPK deployment failure; a mixed `fpc_on`/`fpc_off` team
  giving every kit config the FPC values; an FPC team's unexported kit slots
  patched from the installed cup entries (Fox and pre-Fox), including the no-existing-entry
  `kit_config_fpc_unpatched` warning; logs/overrides/output path resolution in portable and
  user-config modes; invalid-UTF-8 and empty `notes.txt`; invalid `settings.toml` leaving the
  player compiled with default settings while models continue.
- **Infrastructure**: oversized memory requests, MemoryBudget wake-up stress with multiple oversized
  waiters, and automatic worker counts on one- and two-core hosts; solid-7z reads not copying the
  archive buffer per entry; a solid 7z with unnumbered players; `CpkStem` boundary cases (empty, 29
  characters, spaces, separators, reserved device names, explicit `.cpk`, case collisions);
  standalone
  kit-config binary → TOML → binary preservation of source texture-name fields.

Separate **Red parity** (normalized archive-entry equivalence is acceptable) from **Rust
reproducibility**. Explicit CPU mode is the deterministic reference: identical inputs and encoder
configuration must produce byte-identical CPK, test, and sideload artifacts, including canonical
ordering and normalized timestamps. Savefiles use fresh randomized encryption salts, so compare
them after decryption and semantic normalization, or inject a deterministic RNG in tests.
