# 4cc Studio — Savefile plan

Covers the `pes_savefile` lib crate: the EDIT00000000 file codec (container crypto,
schema-driven payload codec, player/team/tactics model), the cross-version player
data conversion, the save-to-save operations (aesthetics transplant, aesthetics
fingerprinting), and the interchange formats (Team TOML, legacy `.4ccs`/`.4cct`
readers, Texport, the aesthetics patch). Shared by the [Save editor](../save_editor.md), the
[Team compiler](../team_compiler/README.md), the integrated
[model conversion](../model_conversion/README.md), and the
[Export upgrader](../export_upgrader.md). Platform context is in the
[core plan](../core/README.md).

---

The plan is split into parts; section headings are unchanged from the
single-file plan.

| Part | Covers |
|---|---|
| [Container format and crypto](container.md) | Container format and crypto; Payload layout per version |
| [Save codec](codec.md) | Schema-driven save codec |
| [Data model](model.md) | Player/team/tactics model; Player settings model (settings.toml) |
| [Operations](operations.md) | Cross-version player conversion; Save-to-save operations; Interchange formats; Player section population |
| [Verification](verification.md) | Verification |

## Origin material

The crate consolidates savefile knowledge that today is spread across four codebases:

| Source | Location | Contributes |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| 4ccEditor | `Tools_4cc/4ccEditor-1` (an unofficial fork of the main `Tools_4cc/4ccEditor` with added functionality — strictly better despite being cloned first; use the fork as the reference) | Per-version payload schemas (`pes15.cpp`–`pes20.cpp`), player/team/tactics model (`editor.h`), bit engine (`data_util.cpp`), playstyle conversion tables (`menu_lists.cpp`), `.4ccs`/`.4cct`/Texport formats |
| Midcupping | `Tools_4cc/Midcupping` | Pure-Python reference implementations of the container crypto (PES 15's keyless scheme; PES 16/17 incl. their master keys), aesthetics block layout, transplant and aesthetics-diff logic |
| The converters | `Tools_4cc/4cc-aet-converter-19to16`, `Tools_4cc/aes_converter_16to21` | Container crypto for PES 16/19/21 (`save16.py`/`save19.py`/`save21.py`, incl. master keys), `convertPlayerSaveData` cross-version bitfield surgery |
| pesXdecrypter / libpesXcrypter | `Tools_4cc/pesXdecrypter` (the source of the DLLs; built copies in `Lab/4ccEditor/lib` and `Saves/4ccEditor_betaM/lib`) | All seven master keys (`src/masterkey.c`, incl. the PES 16 myClub variant) and the authoritative container spec (`src/crypt.c`) |

## Crate layout

The crate is organized in layers — bytes → fields → model → operations — and the layout exists to
keep per-version knowledge in exactly one layer. Everything version-specific (keys, container
shapes, bit offsets, payload section offsets) lives under `schema/` and `container/` as *data*; the
codec, the model, and every operation above them are version-generic and take a `&VersionSchema`.

Placement rules:

- **A bit offset appears in `schema/pesNN.rs` or nowhere.** No literal offsets in `codec/`, `model/`,
  or `ops/`; a new field is a `PlayerField` variant plus one table row per version that has it.
  This is what makes the roundtrip tests mechanically verifying.
- **`container/` knows nothing about players; `codec/` knows nothing about encryption.** `file.rs`
  is the only module that composes them.
- **`model/` types have no I/O and no version.** A `PlayerEntry` is the same struct for every
  version; fields a version lacks are `Option`/defaulted and the schema decides what is written.
- **`ops/` and `interchange/` consume `model/` only.** They never touch bytes; if one needs a
  version-specific fact, that fact is a schema query, not a match on `PesVersion`.
- **Reference constants keep their provenance in a doc comment**: each table module says which
  reference read walk it was derived from (by version and record kind, not by tool name:
  `../../CONTRIBUTING.md` keeps legacy tool names out of code), and `codec.md` "Schema-driven save codec"
  holds the derivation method, so a mismatch found by a roundtrip test can be traced in one hop.
- Lib dependencies are `fpc` (the FPC system's data) and nothing format-specific; no Blender, egui,
  or tool dependency: this crate is consumed by `aatf`, the Team compiler, the Save
  editor, the Export upgrader, and the Player aesthetics editor, and must stay `wasm32`-checkable
  (core plan guardrail 6); discovery's filesystem walk is `cfg`-gated for non-desktop targets.
