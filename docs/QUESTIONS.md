# Open questions for the maintainer

The one list of what only the maintainer can answer: in-game behavior, cup practice, a
preference between options the plan does not pick. The lead adds an entry when it parks a
question (`AGENTS.md` "When the plan has gaps") and removes it when answered, logging the
answer where it belongs (a plan edit and a `DECISIONS.md` entry, or a worklog note). Lead and
sidekick work in progress stays in `WORKLOG.md` "Issues"; this file holds nothing the lead can
settle itself. Entries are grouped by what an answer unblocks, newest last within a group; each
names where the question came from so the context can be read there.

### Face diffs are engine-specific
From: maintainer, 2026-10-03 (worklog Issues). A `face_diff.bin` (or its `face_diff.xml` and
`<dif>` text forms) authored for one engine misplaces the face on the other, as the kit layout
did; the compiler passes a diff through for whatever target it compiles. Deferred until after
Phase 4's kits work. To investigate then: what differs (format, bones moved, rest pose),
whether one engine's diff converts into the other's, and how a folder says which engine its
diff is for (the kit layout's `pre-fox`/`fox` markers are the model). Say when.
