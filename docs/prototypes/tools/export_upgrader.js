// The Export upgrader's draft (plans/export_upgrader.md "GUI"), a view of the
// drafts' host page, index.html: the two drop targets (an old export, or a
// folder of old model folders), the run's arguments (the discovered save or
// the loose switch), the Upgrade run and its report - the log panel, the
// left-behind list, the done line, the notice and Move to exports and compile.
// The samples are real recorded runs (.tmp/8_17/runs/): the egg export end to
// end, a zip, a referee export, a not-clean, a refused and an aborted run, and
// both model-folder outcomes, with the stand-in pickers and the close prompt.
// The wrapper keeps the view's names out of the host's scope; its body is left
// unindented, as in tools/save_editor.js.
// Names this script uses without declaring them (render, h, row, weak, strong,
// button, combo, cb, collapsing, window_, closeWindow, publishNotice,
// shellPesVersion, switchToTool, toolActivity, folderOf, mmss,
// EXE_FOLDER, appendLog, logPanel, openOutputStub, named, registerTool) are the
// host's, index.html.
(() => {
"use strict";

// The view's own rules the shared stylesheet does not already hold: the two
// equal columns the targets sit in, a target's minimum height and filled
// border, the left-behind list's cap and scroll.
