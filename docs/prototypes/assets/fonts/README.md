# Fonts

`phosphor-subset.ttf` is the shell's icon font until the suite's own replaces it (worklog 8.14):
the 19 glyphs the suite draws, cut from the regular weight of Phosphor Icons, as the
`egui-phosphor` 0.14.0 crate ships it (`res/Phosphor.ttf`, SHA-256 `06b91e02…`). The cut
keeps each glyph at its Phosphor codepoint and drops the ligatures, so text never turns into
an icon. `studio_core`'s icon constants name the glyphs.

This file is a copy of `resources/fonts/phosphor-subset.ttf` for the drafts.

The other files are the rest of the app's font chain (`plans/core/gui.md`, the Dark/light theme
row), so the drafts draw text in exactly the files the app does, never in a system font:

| File | What | Source | SHA-256 | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Selawik-Regular.ttf` | the body font, Microsoft's metric twin of Segoe UI | Selawik 1.01, `selawk.ttf` of `github.com/microsoft/Selawik` release 1.01 (`Selawik_Release.zip`) | `e9d98518…` | SIL OFL 1.1 (below; the repository's `LICENSE.txt`) |
| `Selawik-Semibold.ttf` | the pitch's formation name alone, the weight whose stroke matches the game's label as egui draws it (worklog 0.0.1x) | Selawik 1.01, `selawksb.ttf` of the same release | `0a9e9d05…` | SIL OFL 1.1, as the regular weight's (below) |
| `Hack-Regular.ttf` | monospace | egui 0.37's own copy (`epaint_default_fonts` 0.37.0) | `15f55cc0…` | below (egui's `Hack-Regular.txt`) |
| `egui-icons.ttf` | egui's own icons (scale 0.90) | the same crate | `12280655…` | below (egui's `egui-icons.txt`) |
| `symbols.ttf` | the symbols the body font lacks (→, ≡, ✔, ✖ and the like), on its metrics | `scripts/make_symbols.py`'s build of `resources/symbols/`, which writes this copy and `resources/fonts/symbols.ttf` | `ac29b6db…` | the repository's own |

egui-icons' scale is epaint's `FontTweak`, `size-adjust` in the host's `@font-face` rule.

## Licence of `egui-icons.ttf`

```
egui-icons.ttf

A subset of emoji-icon-font.ttf (https://github.com/jslegers/emoji-icon-font),
containing only the five glyphs that egui exposes as `egui::special_emojis`:

    U+E618  the Android logo
    U+E61F  the Windows logo
    U+E624  the GitHub logo
    U+E625  the word `git`
    U+F8FF  the Apple logo

No platform font has these, so egui bundles them even when the rest of
emoji-icon-font.ttf is left out (the `monochrome_emoji_fonts` feature).

Regenerate with:

    pip install fonttools
    python3 -m fontTools.subset emoji-icon-font.ttf \
        --unicodes=E618,E61F,E624,E625,F8FF \
        --no-hinting --desubroutinize \
        --output-file=egui-icons.ttf

The license is that of emoji-icon-font.ttf: see emoji-icon-font-mit-license.txt.
