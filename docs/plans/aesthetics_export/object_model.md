# 4cc Studio — Aesthetics export plan: Object model

Part of the [Aesthetics export plan](README.md). Section headings are unchanged from the single-file plan, so an existing pointer to a section still names it; only the file part of the pointer changed.

## Object Model

The pipeline operates on typed objects, not a flat dict of path strings to bytes. The `VirtualTree`
remains as the serialization layer (used at load and pack time only).

**The model and its validation live in `libs/aesthetics_export`, not in the Team compiler.** The export format is
shared knowledge: the Export upgrader writes it, the Kit config editor edits kit folders inside it,
and the Team creator generates it from scratch — so one crate owns the object model, the
folder conventions described under "Player folders (the export format)", and the check rules behind
the format-level messages in the catalog. That includes the **structure parser** — canonical
folder/file listing, names/sizes, supplied small metadata such as raw `players.txt`, and link files
→ `ParsedAestheticsExport`, with no model or texture contents. The consumer creates the canonical listing
from a directory walk, ZIP central directory, or 7z entry table and chooses a source provider;
`aesthetics_export` does not own filesystem/archive I/O. `VirtualTree`, lazy per-folder *content* loading,
source-provider implementation, and the memory budget remain pipeline concerns. The Load step's
eager structure loading builds on this parser, and the Refs arranger supplies a plain-filesystem
listing. The Team compiler is the crate's biggest consumer, and the compile-time behavior
(processing steps, packing, bins, GUI, CLI) stays here. The Team compiler itself is deliberately
*not* split into a companion lib crate — see "Lib crates" in the [core plan](../core/README.md).

`TeamName`, `TeamId` and the `teams_list.txt` parse/reconcile logic live in the leaf crate
`libs/teams_list` (see the [library crates plan](../libs/README.md)); this crate depends on it for identity
resolution and contributes only the export-format half — splitting the display name into the
token that `TeamName::new` folds. `studio_core` never parses the list or interprets team IDs.

The eager object model stores **structure descriptors, not loaded contents**: a processing task
later resolves each descriptor through the pipeline's source access (direct file, ZIP entry, or
solid-7z buffer) and materializes the folder under its memory permit; loaded bytes stay owned by the
loading task until its written output drains, keeping the memory charge aligned with byte lifetime.
`ParsedAestheticsExport`, `ValidatedAestheticsExport`, `ResolvedAestheticsExport`, `PlayerFolder`, and the descriptor
types belong to `aesthetics_export`; loaded processing types such as `FaceModelFolder` and their
conversion/packing methods belong to `team_compiler`, avoiding inherent implementations of
shared-lib types in the tool crate.

**Validation boundary.** Structural validation (folder tree, naming, roster, link-file references,
file-type allowlists) lives in `aesthetics_export` and returns a `ValidationReport` containing the parsed
draft, every issue, and an optional **sanitized** `ValidatedAestheticsExport`: a bad optional file or
folder is omitted while valid siblings remain, with every original issue preserved for reporting.
Foundational failures — unsafe virtual paths, roster-wide ambiguity, unparsable required metadata —
never produce a valid affected scope and cannot be restored by `pass_through`; isolated malformed
roster lines remain `RosterEntry`/`DropSlot` findings. Invalid drafts remain renderable and
repairable in the GUI; unreadable sources and unsafe virtual paths are hard parser errors. Deep
format validation (FMDL/XML/MTL/glTF/texture/kit-config content checks) lives in the respective
format crates and applies the same sanitized-scope rule before planning. The consuming tool maps
`ValidationIssue`s to `Message`s with its own catalog policy — so the Refs arranger and Kit config
editor can consume the same structural checks without inheriting Team-compiler-specific catalog
entries.

The compile progression is **`ParsedAestheticsExport` → `ValidatedAestheticsExport` (structural + deep
validation, sanitized) → `ResolvedAestheticsExport` (identity attached) → build manifest (run-level
planning)**. Parsing retains raw roster entries and issues so malformed input stays reportable;
planning resolves dependencies, IDs, destinations, and collisions serially before parallel work
starts.

### Validation semantics

These settle the Team compiler plan's pre-Phase-3 gates (identity boundary, sanitized versus
eligible, roster-entry scope and disposition; confirmed 2026-09-30).

- **Identity boundary.** The export kind follows from the canonical `team_name`: `/refs/` is a
  referee export, `/balls/` never reaches this crate (the consumer's discovery skips it), anything
  else is a normal team. `validate` derives the kind from `team_name` itself, so the referee rules
  (required `players.txt`, slots 01–35, repeated folders) need no input from the consumer.
  `resolve_identity` maps `/refs/` to `ExportIdentity::Referees` without reading the teams list,
  and any other name to `ExportIdentity::Team { id, name }` by `TeamsList` lookup, or to
  `IdentityError` (the Team compiler's `team_name_unknown`). No referee value is ever a `TeamId`;
  999 appears only where a game format writes it. An export stem with no token has no team name:
  it is reported as `team_name_unknown` with an empty name and dropped.
- **Coverage tag.** A team export's name says what the export covers, as its second word, right
  after the team name, in any letter case: `Full` (everything the team has: `co Full Spring
  26`) or `Midcup` (changes to add to what is installed: `co Midcup Day 5`). The compiler needs
  to know, because the game offers as many kits as the team's record counts and (Fox) reads a
  player's boots from his row: only a full export may reset what the team had before, and
  nothing in an export's content tells the two apart (a full export of a team with two kits
  looks like a midcup export bringing two kits). It is in the name, not in a marker file, so
  whoever handles the export sees it without opening it, and a name with neither word is an
  error that drops the export (the Team compiler's `export_tag_missing`) rather than a guess:
  a full export taken for a midcup one leaves the kits of a past cup on offer, and the
  reverse wipes a team's kits. Only the second word counts, so a later `Full` in a
  description changes nothing. A referee export carries no tag: it is always full.
- **Who decides a consequence.** This crate decides each structural issue's disposition, because
  it builds the sanitized export from them: a `ValidationIssue` carries its code, scope, context,
  effective disposition, and whether `pass_through` changed it. The consuming tool owns only
  severity, text and hint (the Team compiler's catalog in `messages.md`); the tool tests that
  every code in `ISSUE_CODES` has a catalog row, and its scenario tests observe the consequence
  each row states. Settings that change a
  consequence reach the crate through `ValidationContext`: the target `PesVersion` (Fox or pre-Fox
  allowed names), `strict_file_type_check`, `pass_through`, and the texture stems the installed
  CPKs hold in the team's Common output, which satisfy a texture `.common` link whose target is
  not in `Common/` (`team_compiler/pipeline.md` "Resolved decisions", "A texture a model names
  must exist").
- **Sanitized versus eligible.** `ValidatedAestheticsExport` holds exactly the eligible content:
  every item no issue drops. `ValidationReport.parsed` still holds everything and `issues` every
  finding, so a dropped folder stays renderable and a broken roster repairable. `validated` is
  `None` exactly when some issue's effective disposition is `DropExport`. `pass_through` turns an
  eligible `DropFile`/`DropFolder` into `Keep`: the item stays in the validated export and its
  issue stays in the report, marked as passed through, so the tool reports it at its severity and
  finishes that scope as `DoneWithErrors`. `DropSlot`, `DropExport` and the codes the catalog
  marks not eligible are never kept. The deep pass applies the same rule ("Content findings").
- **Content findings.** This crate reads no file content, so the deep pass's findings come from
  the consumer, which checks the files of the first report's `validated` (what the structure
  pass dropped is not read). `ValidationReport::with_content_findings` takes them and returns
  the report validation would have made had they been its own. A `ContentFinding` carries the
  consumer's code (its own; the one `ISSUE_CODES` member a consumer also reports is
  `logo_file_invalid`, for a logo that does not decode), the scope, the context, the disposition asked
  for, and whether `pass_through` may keep it; an eligible `DropFile`/`DropFolder` becomes
  `Keep` under `pass_through`, marked as passed through, like the structure pass's own. In the
  report's issues they stand after the model folders' and `Common/`'s own findings and before
  the cascade (the kit, portrait and root-file findings follow the cascade), so a
  player linking a shared folder or `Common/` file that a content finding drops gets
  `link_target_dropped` naming that finding, and a shared folder left with no linking player
  `shared_folder_orphaned`. What a scope drops: a `Folder` scope a player, shared or kit
  folder; a `File` scope a `Common/` file, a `Portraits/` file, a `Collars/` file, a logo file
  (the logo goes as one unit), or a player folder's `settings.toml` or `portrait.*`, the folder
  keeping everything else; `DropExport` on the `Export` scope leaves `validated: None`.
- **Roster entries.** A finding about one `players.txt` (or `refs.txt`) line is `RosterEntry`-scoped:
  the file, the 1-based line number, and the slot when it parsed. Line-local findings
  (`players_txt_line_invalid`, `players_txt_slot_invalid`, `players_txt_target_missing`) are
  `DropSlot`: that assignment goes and the other lines stand. Duplicate slots are found first,
  over every complete line (a slot and a folder name) whose slot is in range, before any target
  is looked up (a bare `03` is `players_txt_line_invalid` and claims nothing): a stale
  `03 OldName` above `03 NewName` is a duplicate even when `OldName` does not exist (both findings
  are reported). Roster-wide findings drop the
  export: a slot assigned twice (`players_txt_slot_duplicate`, on each later line), a file that is
  not UTF-8, and a referee roster left with no valid assignment (`players_txt_invalid`,
  `File`-scoped). A folder named by a line counts as listed even when that line is dropped, so it
  gets no `player_unlisted` on top; a line whose slot does not parse names no folder. A folder no
  remaining assignment maps is not compiled, and its links reference nothing: a shared folder
  counts as referenced only by an eligible, roster-mapped player (otherwise
  `shared_folder_orphaned`). Without `players.txt`, number findings are
  `Folder`-scoped `DropFolder`: `player_folder_number_invalid`, and `player_number_duplicate` on
  every folder claiming the slot.
- **Dropped link targets.** Sanitizing never leaves a reference to something it removed. A
  player folder whose shared-folder or `.common` link names a target the structure pass dropped
  (a shared folder discarded for a disallowed file, a Common file discarded as disallowed) is
  dropped too, with `link_target_dropped` naming the link and the target's own finding. The
  trigger is the target's effective disposition: under `pass_through` a kept target keeps its
  dependants and no `link_target_dropped` is reported.
- **Unread metadata.** The CLI's `check` and `compile` read every small metadata file, from a
  solid `.7z` too (the buffer that read decompresses is released before the next archive is
  admitted; compiling decompresses again); only the GUI's shallow live check leaves a solid archive's roster unread, and
  that state (a report that is neither valid nor refused) is designed with live validation in
  Phase 8. `SmallMetadata` distinguishes a file that is absent from one that was not read, so
  that addition changes no shape.
- **Refused listings.** A listing `vtree` refuses (a path escaping the root, two names that fold
  to one) is a `SourceError` from `parse_listing`: there is no draft to report on, and the
  consumer reports it as a source failure naming the path (the Team compiler's
  `export_extract_failed`).
- **File-type allowlist.** What a file may be depends on where it sits; a file the row does not
  admit gets the row's code. *Model content* is models (any format), textures, `.skl`, `.fclo`,
  `.xml`, `.mtl`, material tomls and `.bin`.

  | Where the file sits | Admits | Otherwise |
  |---|---|---|
  | directly in a player folder | model content, shared and `.common` links, the `ingame_face`, `fpc_on` and `fpc_off` markers, `settings.toml` | `file_type_disallowed` |
  | directly in a player folder's `face/`, `boots/` or `gloves/` | model content, `.common` links | `file_type_disallowed` |
  | directly in a player folder's `common/` | textures | `file_type_disallowed` |
  | directly in a shared folder | model content | `file_type_disallowed` |
  | directly in a kit folder | textures, `config.toml`, `colors.txt`, the `pre-fox`, `fox` and `icon_<N>` markers | `file_type_disallowed` |
  | directly in `Common/` | model content | `common_file_disallowed` |
  | directly in `Collars/` | model files (any model format; the game draws a collar with the kit texture, so it has no textures or materials of its own, `team_compiler/pipeline.md` "Collars"); their `collar_<ID>` name is the compiler's to check, since which IDs exist depends on the target version (`collar_id_invalid`) | `file_type_disallowed` |
  | anywhere in `Kits/all/` | textures directly in it | `kit_all_file_ignored` |
  | anywhere in `Portraits/` | textures named `player_NN` directly in it | `portrait_name_invalid` |
  | at the root | `players.txt`, `notes.txt`, `colors.txt`, `README.txt`, `logo*` textures, a team export's `autopilot` marker; a referee export also `refs.txt`, `ref_lists.txt`, `ref_marker.dds` | `root_file_unexpected` |

  A file below a subfolder the table does not name takes the code of the folder holding that
  subfolder (`Players/03 - A/extra/x.dds` is `file_type_disallowed`). The list is the same for
  every target: each model
  format is a source for either engine through conversion, so what a target does not emit is the
  deep pass's and processing's concern, not the allowlist's (Red's per-engine lists predate
  conversion). With `strict_file_type_check` off, `file_type_disallowed` and
  `common_file_disallowed` keep their item (`Keep`, which the consumer shows as Info) and the file
  stays in the folder's files, to be packed as it is; a kit emits only its named textures, so a
  kept kit simply does not use it.
- **OS artifacts.** `Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini` and `.DS_Store` (any case, at any depth) are
  written by file browsers, never by authors: `parse_listing` leaves them out of the draft and
  reports nothing. On 2026-10-01 the maintainer's team exports held 209 `Thumbs.db` and 16
  `desktop.ini` files inside model folders; as disallowed files, each would have dropped its folder
  under the default strict check.
- **Folder names.** A player folder name (without `players.txt`) and a kit folder name are
  `<head>[ - <label>]`: split at the first `-`, both sides trimmed. The head is the slot (decimal
  `01`–`23`, or a `KitSlot`, or `all`); the label is the player name or the kit label, and a
  player folder without one is named by its whole folder name, as every folder listed in
  `players.txt` is. `03 - Jean-Pierre` is player 03, Jean-Pierre.
- **Issue scope.** An issue's scope names the item its disposition acts on. `DropFile` issues are
  `File`-scoped; a disallowed file's `file_type_disallowed` is `Folder`-scoped (the folder it
  drops), one issue per file with the file in its context. Roster findings keep the scopes above.
- **Pass-through eligibility.** In the structure pass, exactly `link_target_missing`,
  `common_link_missing`, `file_type_disallowed` and `common_file_disallowed` are eligible; every
  other drop it decides belongs to one of the not-eligible classes in `team_compiler/messages.md`
  "Message structure".
- **Drop order.** A folder's own findings come first, then `link_target_dropped` for each player
  whose link target was dropped, then `shared_folder_orphaned` over the players still eligible
  and roster-mapped: a shared folder linked only by a dropped player is orphaned.
- **Export findings of `validate`.** A stem with no token is `team_name_unknown` with an empty
  name, and an export holding no content-folder entry and no root `logo*` texture is
  `export_empty`, both `DropExport`. No root-level finding (`export_empty`, `root_file_unexpected`,
  the logo codes, `notes.txt`'s) is reported beside `nested_root_ambiguous` or
  `nested_root_conflict`, which leave the root undecided (its folders are the candidate roots and
  its files are not yet the export's root files). A name the teams list lacks is
  `resolve_identity`'s `IdentityError`.
- **Texture stems.** A lookup namespace (`team_compiler/messages.md` `texture_stem_conflict`)
  holds its textures plus, in a player folder, each texture `.common` link under its linked name
  (`hair.png.common` is `hair`), as a link counts as the linked file being local
  (`model_format.md` "Rules"). `Common/` is one namespace: its conflicting files drop each other
  (`File`, `DropFile`), and the cascade then drops the players linking them.
- **Kits, portraits, logo.** A `kit_folder_invalid` folder gets no other finding: which
  allowlist its contents answer to is unknown (it may be a misspelled `all`), and it is dropped
  whole anyway. `all` counts as a slot for `kit_slot_duplicate`. `all/` textures
  follow a kit's `kit` prefix rule (`kit_texture_name_invalid`). `kit_all_unused` (no kit folder
  survives) changes nothing (`Keep`). `kit_textures_inherited` lists the inherited stems without
  their `kit_` prefix, alphabetically (`back, leg, name`). A kit's icon is the number in its one
  `icon_<N>` marker's name: one numbered above 23 is `kit_icon_invalid`, and two or more are
  each `kit_icon_invalid` whatever their numbers (`File`, `DropFile`; the kit keeps the default
  icon).
  `Portraits/player_NN.*` maps to slot NN; two files of one stem there are
  `texture_stem_conflict`, dropping both files. `portrait_conflict` compares contents, so it
  belongs to the deep pass (Phase 4). Every root file whose stem starts with `logo` is a logo
  candidate; `logo_file_invalid`, `logo_role_duplicate` and `logo_small_without_main` each drop
  the logo as one unit (`File`-scoped on the offending file, `DropFile`, `logo: None`).
  `team_colors_missing` belongs to the bins stage (Phase 4).

### `aesthetics_export` crate layout

Five consumers (Team compiler, Export upgrader, Kit config editor, Refs arranger, future Team
Creator) read this crate, so its layout is organized by the **progression stage** a consumer can
stop at, and each stage is produced by the previous one's entry point:

```

└── kit_config_toml.rs  # config.toml ↔ kit_config binary bridge for exports (comment-preserving)
```

Placement rules:

- **No I/O.** Consumers supply a `CanonicalListing` (from a directory walk, ZIP central directory,
  or 7z entry table) and, where content is needed for deep checks, the bytes; this crate never opens
  a file or archive. `players_txt.rs` returns bytes and an atomic-replace *plan*; the caller writes.
- **No message text.** `validate/issues.rs` yields stable codes with scope and context; each tool
  maps them to its own catalog. This is what lets the Refs arranger and Kit config editor share the
  checks without inheriting Team compiler wording.
- **Structure, not contents.** Descriptor types carry names and sizes; loaded model/texture types
  (`FaceModelFolder`, …) and everything that converts or packs them live in `team_compiler`.
- **Conventions are data.** A new allowed model name or kit file is a table entry in
  `conventions/`, and every consumer picks it up; no consumer keeps its own list. Two rules that
  read like compiler behavior are conventions and live here, because a second consumer already
  depends on them: the **model source selection rule** (target-native first, then glTF, then the
  convertible opposite native format — the Player aesthetics editor uses it to decide which set
  opens visible and why leftover natives must be removed after a glTF conversion), and the
  **structural file-kind classification** of a model folder's files (model, texture, `GltfBuffer`,
  `PotentialGltfImage`, link file, marker, disallowed — from names alone; `model_convert`'s glTF
  dependency contract takes this classification as its input and only *promotes* candidates during
  deep URI resolution).
- **Deep format validation is not here.** FMDL/XML/MTL/glTF/texture/kit-config content checks live
  in their format crates; `validate/` only orchestrates the structural layer and the sanitized-scope
  rule that deep checks then reuse.
- `wasm32`-checkable and GUI-free (it is the Studio Web cheap tier's export knowledge).

pub enum ValidatedRoster {
    Team(BTreeMap<PlayerSlot, PlayerIndex>),
    Referees(BTreeMap<RefSlot, PlayerIndex>),
}
// Parsing retains raw roster entries and issues so duplicate slots remain
// reportable. A referee roster may map several RefSlots to the same PlayerIndex.

pub enum ExportIdentity {
    Team { id: TeamId, name: TeamName },   // TeamId is strictly 701–920
    Referees,                            // rendered as fixed game ID 999 only at format boundaries

```

The compiler supports **only the Studio export format**. The old format (separate Faces/Boots/Gloves
item folders with embedded IDs, Kit Configs/Kit Textures folders, the Other folder) is not supported
— old exports are migrated with the Export upgrader tool (see the [Export upgrader
plan](../export_upgrader.md)). Consequences:

- No `KitConfigFolder`/`KitTextureFolder`: kits live in the `Kits/` folder, one subfolder per kit.
- No `Other` folder support.
- `Faces`/`Boots`/`Gloves` folders still exist in the Studio format for models **shared between
  players**, but they are identified by **name only** (no embedded IDs). Player folders are the main
  reference point: a player folder references a shared folder with a link file (e.g. `Crocs.boots`).
  At compile time, each shared **boots/gloves** folder gets an auto-assigned ID, and every linked
  player gets that ID (Fox: his `BootsList`/`GloveList` row in the output CPK; pre-Fox: written to
  the savefile; only if the shared folder's output actually commits).
  Shared *face* folders take no ID: pre-Fox copies the shared face folder per linked player (local
  files layered on top), and Fox merges the parts into each player's own FMDL — see "A link plus
  local models combines" below.

```rust
// libs/aesthetics_export: parsing preserves invalid raw input for diagnostics and is
// source-neutral: the consumer supplies a canonical listing (from a directory walk,
// ZIP directory, or 7z entry table) plus small metadata; aesthetics_export owns no I/O.
pub fn parse_listing(
    listing: CanonicalListing,
    metadata: SmallMetadata,
) -> Result<ParsedAestheticsExport, SourceError>;
impl ParsedAestheticsExport {
    // Infallible: every structural failure is a ValidationIssue, a foundational one included
    // (DropExport, `validated: None`); what cannot be parsed at all is parse_listing's SourceError.
    pub fn validate(self, context: &ValidationContext) -> ValidationReport;
}
impl ValidatedAestheticsExport {
    pub fn resolve_identity(self, teams_list: &TeamsList)
        -> Result<ResolvedAestheticsExport, IdentityError>;
}

// tools/team_compiler: serial run-level planning over all resolved exports
// produces the immutable manifest; scoped failures drop tasks/exports while
// a manifest for valid siblings still proceeds (partial planning). `plan_run`,
// `process_task` and their types are the tool's own: their shapes live in
// `team_compiler/pipeline.md` "Run driver shapes (Phase 3)", not here.
// Model tasks carry immutable IDs assigned by plan_run; processing only consumes
// those assignments, never allocates. The writer commits successful batches and
// releases their permits.
```

### Structure pass types

The inputs, the draft, the issues and the small value types of the structure pass. The Core types
above are the sanitized output; everything here is what reaches it.

```rust
// ---- Input (listing.rs). The consumer lists one export source; parse_listing canonicalizes.
pub struct CanonicalListing {
    pub display_name: String,        // the source's stem: folder name, or archive name without extension
    pub entries: Vec<ListedEntry>,   // any order
}
pub struct ListedEntry {
    pub path: String,                // as the source spells it, relative to the source root
    pub kind: ListedKind,
}
pub enum ListedKind {
    File { size: u64 },
    Folder,                          // needed only for a folder with nothing below it (an empty kit)
}

/// The small files the structure pass reads, keyed by `ListedEntry::path`. The consumer reads
/// every listed file `is_small_metadata` accepts; a failed read carries its reason
/// (`source_read_failed`, with the disposition of what the file is: `DropExport` for a roster,
/// `DropFile` for `notes.txt`). A listed file missing from the map was not read:
/// Phase 3 treats it as a failed read; the GUI's shallow check gives it its own state in Phase 8.
pub struct SmallMetadata {
    pub files: BTreeMap<String, Result<Vec<u8>, String>>,

// (case-insensitive) at any depth, so the consumer needs no root normalization of its own.

    pub installed_common_textures: BTreeSet<String>,

    pub passed_through: bool,                 // pass_through turned a DropFile/DropFolder into Keep
}
pub enum IssueScope {                         // within the one export this crate sees

// ---- File kinds (conventions/file_types.rs), from the name alone. A stray `.txt` after a

pub enum FileKind {
    Model(ModelFormat),
    Texture,                  // an accepted image extension
    Skl, Fclo, Xml, Mtl, MaterialsToml,

pub enum MetadataFile {
    PlayersTxt, RefsTxt, RefLists, NotesTxt, ColorsTxt, ConfigToml, SettingsToml, Readme,
}

// ---- Slots.
pub struct PlayerSlot(u8);                    // 01–23: a normal team's roster slot
impl PlayerSlot {
    pub fn new(slot: u8) -> Option<PlayerSlot>;
    pub fn get(self) -> u8;
    pub fn player_id(self, team: TeamId) -> u32; // team * 100 + slot (92023 at most: past u16)
}
pub struct RefSlot(u8);                       // 01–35: a referee roster slot
impl RefSlot {
    pub fn new(slot: u8) -> Option<RefSlot>;
    pub fn get(self) -> u8;
}
```

Kits key on `kit_config::KitSlot` ("Design constraints"). `ExportSlot` (a team or referee slot,
`split_player`'s input) and `BootsId`/`GlovesId` belong to the Team compiler's Phase 4 planning,
not to this crate. `players_txt.rs` and `kit_config_toml.rs` get their shapes with their
consumers (the Refs arranger; the Phase 4 kit step).

### Model files

Files within model folders are typed. Files that the processing code needs to look inside get rich
structs; files that are just passed through stay opaque.

```rust
pub enum ModelFile {
    // Ancillary files only: every FMDL/.model/glTF source and sibling MTL is owned
    // exactly once by a ModelPart below.
    Texture(TextureFile),    // Has format, mipmaps, conversion methods
    Xml(XmlFile),            // Parsed DOM, has editing methods
    Skl(SklFile),            // Paired with a same-basename .fmdl; content-hashed for merge checks
    Fclo(FcloFile),          // Opaque or parsed depending on needs
    RawBin(RawFile),         // Opaque game/template bin
    Other(RawFile),          // Opaque
}

pub struct RawFile {
    pub relative_path: vtree::RelativeScopePath, // canonical within the folder
    data: Arc<[u8]>,
}
```

### Model folders

```rust
pub struct FaceModelFolder {
    pub model_id: String,
    pub folder_name: String,
    pub files: Vec<ModelFile>, // ancillary textures/XML/SKL/FCLO/raw bins only
    pub parts: Vec<ModelPart>, // owns every selected model source exactly once
}

pub struct ModelPart {
    pub logical_output: String,             // resolved allowed output name / XML entry
    pub source: ModelSource,
    pub material_source: Option<MaterialSource>, // optional folder/glTF material overrides
    pub provenance: ModelProvenance,        // local, shared-folder, or Common link
}

pub enum ModelSource {
    Fox(FmdlFile),
    PreFox { model: PreFoxModel, mtl: MtlFile }, // one atomic native bundle
    Gltf(GltfModel),
    Intermediate(CanonicalModel),  // after conversion, before re-serialization
}

impl FaceModelFolder {
    pub fn fmdls(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &FmdlFile>;
    pub fn textures(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &TextureFile>;
    pub fn validate(&self, context: &ValidationContext) -> Vec<ValidationIssue>;
    pub fn convert_textures(&mut self, settings: &Settings) -> Result<()>;
    pub fn convert_to(&mut self, target: ModelFormat) -> Result<()>;
    pub fn pack(&self, settings: &Settings) -> Vec<PackedEntry>;
}
```

`convert_to` converts every selected part to the target-native format before parts are grouped by
`logical_output` for Fox merging or pre-Fox XML generation. A pre-Fox part always owns its `.model`
and sibling `.mtl` as one native bundle; conversion consumes or produces both atomically and commits
the replacement only after both succeed. Material-definition files pair with their models here for
both formats by the same stem name-matching, each with its own resolution rule: pre-Fox `.mtl` via
Red's cascade (exactly one per model), glTF `*.materials.toml` via the layered least→most-specific
merge (see the [Unified model format plan](../model_format.md)'s "Material files"). For both, a
`.common` link file (`body.mtl.common`, `body.materials.toml.common`) stands in for the Common
file of that name, and a `.common`-linked *model* resolves its material files in Common first with
the player folder's matches layered on top (format plan, "Link files"). This represents
mixed local/shared/Common assemblies without forcing a model folder into one singular source format.
`BootsModelFolder` and `GlovesModelFolder` use the same `parts`/ancillary-`files` structure and
processing contract as `FaceModelFolder`.

### Player folders

The new per-player export format (see `player_folders.md` "Player folders (the Studio export format)") is represented as
its own type, which the coordinator splits into standard model folders:

```rust
pub struct PlayerFolder {
    // No number field: numbering is a roster property, not folder content —
    // slots map to folders in ValidatedAestheticsExport.roster (a referee folder is identical
    // regardless of how many slots point at it). Folder→slots, when needed
    // (process once, pack per slot), is derived by grouping the roster.
    pub path: vtree::ScopePath,     // `Players/03 - A`: the scope its issues and events name
    pub player_name: String,        // the folder name without its `NN - ` number
    pub files: Vec<FileDescriptor>, // names, sizes, kinds — contents load later, per task
    pub links: Vec<SharedLink>,     // shared-folder link files (e.g. "Crocs.boots" → shared Boots/Crocs/);
                                    //   `.common` links (models, material files) are `files` entries
                                    //   of link kind, resolved against the Common folder by the pipeline
    pub ingame_face: bool,          // recognized ingame_face / ingame_face.txt marker
    pub fpc: Option<FpcDirective>,  // normalized fpc_on/fpc_off directive
    pub portrait: Option<FileDescriptor>,
    pub settings: Option<FileDescriptor>,  // settings.toml
}
// Every source file has exactly one semantic role. `files` holds model-pipeline
// content — everything categorization routes and the model tasks consume
// (models, textures, material definition files, skeletons), however it reaches
// the output: emitted transformed, converted, or embedded by conversion. Typed
// fields hold savefile-stage inputs (settings, portrait, FPC markers) and
// folder-level references (links). Typed metadata and glTF dependencies are not
// also retained as pass-through output files. Files inside a reserved
// subfolder (face/, boots/, gloves/, common/ — see "Reserved subfolders") are
// ordinary `files` entries: their ScopePath keeps the subfolder, and
// categorization reads the forced category from it instead of the file name.

pub struct SharedLink {
    pub kind: SharedKind,           // Face / Boots / Gloves
    pub name: String,               // "Crocs"
}
pub enum SharedKind { Face, Boots, Gloves }
pub enum FpcDirective { On, Off }

pub struct FileDescriptor {
    pub path: vtree::ScopePath,     // canonical virtual path within the (normalized) export
    pub source: vtree::ScopePath,   // the same file's path in the source, for reading it; differs
                                    //   from `path` only under a flattened layer
    pub size: u64,
    pub kind: FileKind,             // classified from the name alone ("Structure pass types")
    // glTF files may reference external .bin buffers and image files (any
    // accepted format: DDS, FTEX, PNG, JPEG, BMP, WebP, TGA, TIFF): those
    // dependencies are restricted to the source model folder, loaded once each,
    // and never doubled as pass-through output. Whether an image is a glTF
    // dependency is only known after deep glTF parsing; until then it is a
    // candidate, and unreferenced candidates fall back to the ordinary allowlist.
    // Material references (FMDL/MTL/materials.toml) name textures by stem; the
    // compiler resolves stems to actual files. Two image files with the same
    // stem but different extensions is a `texture_stem_conflict` error.
}

// tools/team_compiler free functions operate on a materialized folder rather
// than adding inherent compile methods to aesthetics_export::PlayerFolder.
pub fn categorize_player(folder: &LoadedPlayerFolder) -> CategorizedModels;

/// Split into standard folders using boots/gloves IDs frozen by plan_run
/// (processing never allocates IDs). `slots` comes from ValidatedAestheticsExport.roster
/// (one entry for ordinary team players, possibly several for referee folders).
pub fn split_player(
    folder: LoadedPlayerFolder,
    identity: &ExportIdentity,
    slots: &[ExportSlot],
    planned_ids: &PlannedModelIds,
) -> (Option<FaceModelFolder>, Option<BootsModelFolder>, Option<GlovesModelFolder>);
// Team and referee folders alike may contain only boots, gloves, portraits,
// or settings — any category may be absent.
```

### Design constraints

- **No parent references.** Pass the resolved `ExportIdentity` and other parent context into child
  processing as parameters rather than storing parent references. Copy only presentation strings
  that a child result must own. This avoids Rust's ownership friction with parent-child references.
- **Strong domain types.** Use validated `TeamName`, `TeamId`, `ExportIdentity`, `PlayerSlot`,
  `RefSlot`, `ExportSlot` (distinguishing team vs referee slots), `BootsId`, `GlovesId`, and
  `CpkStem` types at boundaries rather than passing unvalidated strings and integers through
  processing code. `KitSlot` is `kit_config`'s (the texture and config names it derives are
  format knowledge); this crate parses kit folder names into it.
- **Shared textures.** Rayon's model-folder tasks are cross-thread by construction, so textures
  referenced by multiple tasks use `Arc<[u8]>` exclusively; shared bytes stay charged to the memory
  budget until their last consumer is written.
- **Enums over trait objects.** Use `enum ModelFile` with pattern matching, not `Box<dyn
  ModelFile>`. Exhaustive matching catches missing cases at compile time.
- **Pass-through files stay simple.** A file the compiler moves without processing is `RawFile {
  relative_path, data }` — no behavior-bearing wrapper even when the file is semantically rich (the
  Collars folder's contents are model files, but the compiler never parses them). Only files with
  processing logic get rich types.
