# 4cc Studio — Aesthetics export plan: Object model

> **Plan:** work not built yet (the open phase's sections may be partly built). What the suite does now is described in `docs/spec/`.

## Object Model

### Validation semantics

What exists of this is in `spec/aesthetics_export/object_model.md` "Validation semantics".

A team export's `write_names` marker is also admitted at the root: the aesthetics patch writes
its players' names ("Player settings in exports" in
[`settings_toml.md`](settings_toml.md)).

### `aesthetics_export` crate layout

What exists of this is in `spec/aesthetics_export/object_model.md` "`aesthetics_export` crate layout".

The crate gains one file beyond the tree in the spec:

```
crates/libs/aesthetics_export/src/
└── players_txt.rs      # players.txt writer (Refs arranger) with atomic replacement
```

Placement rules:

- **No I/O.** `players_txt.rs` returns bytes and an atomic-replace *plan*; the caller writes.
- **Conventions are data.** Two rules that
  read like compiler behavior are conventions and live here, because a second consumer already
  depends on them: the **model source selection rule** (target-native first, then glTF, then the
  convertible opposite native format — the Player aesthetics editor uses it to decide which set
  opens visible and why leftover natives must be removed after a glTF conversion), and the
  **structural file-kind classification** of a model folder's files (model, texture, `GltfBuffer`,
  `PotentialGltfImage`, link file, marker, disallowed — from names alone; `model_convert`'s glTF
  dependency contract takes this classification as its input and only *promotes* candidates during
  deep URI resolution).

### Structure pass types

What exists of this is in `spec/aesthetics_export/object_model.md` "Structure pass types".

`ExportSlot` (a team or referee slot, `split_player`'s input) and `BootsId`/`GlovesId` belong to
the Team compiler's planning, not to this crate. `players_txt.rs` gets its shape with its
consumer, the Refs arranger.

### Model files

Files within model folders are typed. Files that the processing code needs to look inside get rich
structs; files that are just passed through stay opaque.

```rust
pub enum ModelFile {
    // Ancillary files only: every FMDL/.model/glTF source and sibling MTL is owned
    // exactly once by a ModelPart below.
    Texture(TextureFile),    // Has format, mipmaps, conversion methods
    Xml(XmlFile),            // Parsed DOM, has editing methods
    Skl(SklFile),            // Paired with a same-basename .fmdl; content-hashed for merge checks
    Fclo(FcloFile),          // Opaque or parsed depending on needs
    RawBin(RawFile),         // Opaque game/template bin
    Other(RawFile),          // Opaque
}

pub struct RawFile {
    pub relative_path: String, // canonical within the folder, by `vtree`'s path rules
    data: Arc<[u8]>,
}
```

### Model folders

```rust
pub struct FaceModelFolder {
    pub model_id: String,
    pub folder_name: String,
    pub files: Vec<ModelFile>, // ancillary textures/XML/SKL/FCLO/raw bins only
    pub parts: Vec<ModelPart>, // owns every selected model source exactly once
}

pub struct ModelPart {
    pub logical_output: String,             // resolved allowed output name / XML entry
    pub source: ModelSource,
    pub material_source: Option<MaterialSource>, // optional folder/glTF material overrides
    pub provenance: ModelProvenance,        // local, shared-folder, or Common link
}

pub enum ModelSource {
    Fox(FmdlFile),
    PreFox { model: PreFoxModel, mtl: MtlFile }, // one atomic native bundle
    Gltf(GltfModel),
    Intermediate(CanonicalModel),  // after conversion, before re-serialization
}

impl FaceModelFolder {
    pub fn fmdls(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &FmdlFile>;
    pub fn textures(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &TextureFile>;
    pub fn validate(&self, context: &ValidationContext) -> Vec<ValidationIssue>;
    pub fn convert_textures(&mut self, settings: &Settings) -> Result<()>;
    pub fn convert_to(&mut self, target: ModelFormat) -> Result<()>;
    pub fn pack(&self, settings: &Settings) -> Vec<PackedEntry>;
}
```

`convert_to` converts every selected part to the target-native format before parts are grouped by
`logical_output` for Fox merging or pre-Fox XML generation. A pre-Fox part always owns its `.model`
and sibling `.mtl` as one native bundle; conversion consumes or produces both atomically and commits
the replacement only after both succeed. Material-definition files pair with their models here for
both formats by the same stem name-matching, each with its own resolution rule: pre-Fox `.mtl` via
Red's cascade (exactly one per model), glTF `*.materials.toml` via the layered least→most-specific
merge (see the [Unified model format plan](../model_format.md)'s "Material files"). For both, a
`.common` link file (`body.mtl.common`, `body.materials.toml.common`) stands in for the Common
file of that name, and a `.common`-linked *model* resolves its material files in Common first with
the player folder's matches layered on top (format plan, "Link files"). This represents
mixed local/shared/Common assemblies without forcing a model folder into one singular source format.
`BootsModelFolder` and `GlovesModelFolder` use the same `parts`/ancillary-`files` structure and
processing contract as `FaceModelFolder`.

### Player folders

What exists of this is in `spec/aesthetics_export/object_model.md` "Player folders".

```rust
// tools/team_compiler free functions operate on a materialized folder rather
// than adding inherent compile methods to aesthetics_export::PlayerFolder.
pub fn categorize_player(folder: &LoadedPlayerFolder) -> CategorizedModels;

/// Split into standard folders using boots/gloves IDs frozen by plan_run
/// (processing never allocates IDs). `slots` comes from ValidatedAestheticsExport.roster
/// (one entry for ordinary team players, possibly several for referee folders).
pub fn split_player(
    folder: LoadedPlayerFolder,
    identity: &ExportIdentity,
    slots: &[ExportSlot],
    planned_ids: &PlannedModelIds,
) -> (Option<FaceModelFolder>, Option<BootsModelFolder>, Option<GlovesModelFolder>);
// Team and referee folders alike may contain only boots, gloves, portraits,
// or settings — any category may be absent.
```

### Design constraints

What exists of this is in `spec/aesthetics_export/object_model.md` "Design constraints".

The strong-types list there additionally names `ExportSlot` (distinguishing team vs referee
slots), `BootsId` and `GlovesId`, none built yet: the Team compiler's planning keys its slots
`PlayerSlot`/`RefSlot` and its boots/gloves IDs are plain `u16` (`plan/ids.rs`).
