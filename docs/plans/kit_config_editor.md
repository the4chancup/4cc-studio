# 4cc Studio — Kit config editor plan

The Kit config editor (`crates/tools/kit_config_editor`, tool id `kit-config-editor`,
sidebar label "Kit config editor") is the successor to **Kit Manager PES2016** by
GOALARG — the closed-source, long-abandoned tool used by the 4cc community to edit kit
config files, in its original form and in a hex-patched "PES2021" variant. As with
the Match tracker, the old name carries no recognition value and does not stay in
the label.

This plan also specifies **`libs/kit_config`**, the lib crate holding the format
knowledge, shared by this tool, the [Team compiler](team_compiler/README.md) (config
generation, FPC reconciliation, compile-time emission), and the
[Export upgrader](export_upgrader.md) (binary → TOML migration) — one crate owns
the format so all three agree on what a valid config is. Platform context is in
the [core plan](core/README.md).

---

## Background

A kit config is a **120-byte binary file** that tells PES how to render a kit:
which shirt/shorts/collar models to use, five fallback colors, number and name
placement, sleeve-badge positions, and which kit textures exist. In game they live
under `common/character0/model/character/uniform/team/{team_id}/` with names like
`702_DEF_1st_realUni.bin`; in Fox-engine versions they are packed into
`UniformParameter.bin` (the `uniparam` lib's container format; Red bundles separate
PES 18 / 19 fallback base files whose stock entries differ, but the container layout
is the same). Every kit in every aesthetics export ships one.

| Tool | Role | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Kit Manager PES2016 v4.0 (GOALARG) | Kit config editing GUI | Closed source, abandoned |
| Kit Manager V4 "pes2021-4cc" | The same exe, hex-patched for PES2021's shirt-name offsets | Ditto |

### Relationship to the old codebase

There is no old codebase: no sources, no format specification anywhere. The format
below was **recovered by disassembling the editor** (capstone scripting over the
~50KB of actual program code — the other 51MB of the exe is prerendered preview
bitmaps): every access to the loaded config buffer was cross-referenced with the
control-creation and message-handler code, giving field offsets, bit packing, value
ranges (combo item counts), and cross-field constraints. Diffing the PES2021 patch
(47 changed bytes) isolated the one field that differs between game versions. The
byte-level behaviors Red/Blue already implemented (texture-name rewriting at 0x28+,
the PES15 shirt-pattern tweak) agree with the recovered layout.

**This section is now the format's reference documentation** — the tool exists so
nobody has to do that archaeology again.

## The format

120 bytes, little-endian, no header. Multi-bit fields packed across byte boundaries
are noted explicitly; bit 0 = LSB. "?" bits are undecoded — the old editor never
reads or writes them, but some are **set in real configs**, so they must be
preserved on rewrite.

| Offset | Bits | Field | Values |
|--------|------|-------|--------|
| 0x00 | 0–1 | Short sleeves type | 1 = normal, 2 = cut-out (shirt model 144 only); 13 PES 2021 stock configs (referees) carry 3, preserved as a raw value |
| 0x00 | 2–7 | ? | 0 in samples |
| 0x01 | all | Shirt model | literal: 144 (0x90), 160 (0xA0), 176 (0xB0) |
| 0x02 | all | Long sleeves type | two values (verified): 0x3E = "Normal & U-Shirt" — one combo entry, the editor's default; 0xBB = "Only-Undershirt" (shirt model 144 only — the editor forces 0x3E on any other model) |
| 0x03 | all | Shorts model | 0–17 |
| 0x04–0x12 | | Five RGB triplets | shirt1, shirt2, undershirt, shorts, socks |
| 0x13 | all | ? | 0 in samples |
| 0x14 | all | Collar | 1-based; the old editor lists 1–107, PES 2021 stock configs carry up to 131 |
| 0x15 | all | Winter collar | as above |

| 0x18 | 5 | ? | |
| 0x18 | 6–7 | Back number size, low 2 bits | size = (0x19[0–1] << 2) \| 0x18[6–7], 0–13 in the old editor; stock configs carry 14 |
| 0x19 | 0–1 | Back number size, high 2 bits | |
| 0x19 | 2–3 | ? | bit 2 set in samples |
| 0x19 | 4–5 | Back number spacing | 0–2 in the old editor; stock configs carry 3 |
| 0x19 | 6–7 | ? | set in samples |

| 0x1B | 0–3 | Chest number size | 0–15 |
| 0x1B | 4–6 | ? | |
| 0x1B | 7 | Tight shirt | on/off (shirt models 144/160 only) |
| 0x1C | 0–3 | ? (PES ≤20) | 8 in samples; PES2021 repurposes bit 3 |
| 0x1C | 4–7 | Name Y, low 4 bits (PES ≤20) | Y = (0x1D[0] << 4) \| 0x1C[4–7], 0–16 |
| 0x1D | 0 | Name Y, high bit | **PES2021**: Y = (0x1D[0] << 5) \| 0x1C[3–7], 0–39 |
| 0x1D | 1–5 | Name size | 0–20 |
| 0x1D | 6–7 | Name shape | 0 = straight, 1/2/3 = light/medium/extreme curve |

| 0x23 | 0 | Badge right-long Y, high bit | |
| 0x23 | 1–7 | ? | |
| 0x24 | 0–3 | ? | 0 in samples |
| 0x24 | 4–7 | Shirt pattern | 0–13 |
| 0x25–0x27 | | ? | 0 in samples |
| 0x28–0x77 | | Five 16-byte texture names | kit, back, chest, leg, name; ASCII, NUL-padded; empty = texture not used |

Notes:

- **Ranges are the old editor's UI limits, not the format's.** Measured on the 1372 kit configs of
  PES 2021's `UniformParameter.bin` (the `kit_config` mass round-trip fixture), stock data exceeds
  the listed ranges where the table says so above and byte 0x13 and bytes 0x25–0x27 are nonzero in
  most configs. `kit_config` therefore preserves every value it reads (enum fields keep a raw
  variant for undocumented values) and its validation flags only what is known to be wrong: a
  collar of 0, a shirt model outside 144/160/176, the cross-field constraints below, and values
  that do not fit the target version's encoding. A stock Konami config validates clean.
- **Sleeve badges** are the four (X, Y) positions of the competition badge: one per
  sleeve (left/right) per kit variant (short/long sleeves).
- **"Shirt model" is a misnomer**, kept because the old editor and the FPC
  constants established it: in game the field only selects the model used for the
  **wrist-end of the long sleeves** when a player wears them — it does not change
  the shirt mesh, and the kit texture's UV layout is identical for all three
  values (which is what lets `color_tools` sample fixed shirt/shorts regions —
  see the [library crates plan](libs/README.md)). The old editor does gate other fields
  on it, as noted below.
- **Collar IDs** index the game's stock collar model set (`nocloth`). Exports can
  replace a stock collar with a custom model (the Team compiler's pass-through
  Collars folder) and point every kit config's collar at the replaced ID — the
  quick way to put a custom model on the whole team.
- **Cross-field constraints** (enforced by the old editor with modal errors, by ours
  inline as warnings): the old editor allowed cut-out short sleeves and undershirt-only long
  sleeves on shirt model 144 only, but PES 2021 stock data carries both on model 160 as well (32
  configs), so `kit_config` warns only when they appear on model 176, which no stock config does;
  tight requires 144 or 160 (a warning likewise). The FPC kit values (shirt 176, shorts 16,
  collar and winter collar 105 — see "FPC toggle" in the
  [Aesthetics export plan](aesthetics_export/README.md)) are
  ordinary values of these fields.
- **Version differences**: PES2021 widens Name Y as noted — the only difference the
  2021 patch makes. PES 15 reads only bits 5–7 of the pattern byte (a 3-bit index, 0–5
  valid) where later versions read bits 4–7; the TOML `pattern` is the 4-bit field every
  version shares, and PES 15 emission maps 4-bit values 12–13 (3-bit 6, which PES 15 has no
  pattern for) to 10–11 (3-bit 5), the byte-level rule the legacy compilers applied to
  configs authored for later versions. Values 14–15 (3-bit 7) have no legacy rule and are
  emitted as is; `validate` reports any value from 12 up as `kit_pattern_unsupported_pes15`
  (warning) when the target is PES 15.
- The five RGB triplets are the config's own kit colors (distinct from
  `UniColor.bin`'s menu colors, which come from `colors.txt`).

## TOML form (`config.toml`)

In the Studio export format, kit configs are canonically authored as **TOML files** —
editable without this tool, exactly like the player folders' `settings.toml`.
The compiler emits the game binary at compile time; no binary config ever appears
inside a Studio-format export. Old exports' binary configs are converted to
`Kits/pN/config.toml` by the [Export upgrader](export_upgrader.md). Auto-generated
configs ship with app-injected comments (predefined per-field documentation);
the editor's `toml_edit`-based writes preserve them.

```toml
# config.toml — one per kit folder (Kits/p1 … p9, g1)

[shirt]
model = 176                 # 144 / 160 / 176
collar = 105                # 1-107
winter_collar = 105         # 1-107
tight = false               # 144/160 only
pattern = 3                 # 0-13 (PES15 output supports 0-5)

shorts = "#43AD58"
socks = "#079144"

[name]
show = true
shape = "straight"          # straight / light-curve / medium-curve / extreme-curve
y = 8                       # 0-16 (PES2021: 0-39)

[badge]                     # sleeve badge positions; x 0-14, y 0-31
right_short = { x = 7, y = 17 }
left_short  = { x = 7, y = 17 }
right_long  = { x = 7, y = 18 }
left_long   = { x = 7, y = 18 }

[unknown]                   # undecoded bits, preserved verbatim (format table above);
"0x19" = 0xC4               # keys only present when they differ from the template
```

For standalone binary conversion only, the optional source-preservation table stores
all five original 16-byte fields as fixed 32-digit hex strings, including NUL padding,
so even noncanonical padding survives exactly:

```toml
[source_texture_names]
kit = "75303730317031000000000000000000"
back = "753037303170315F6261636B00000000"
chest = "00000000000000000000000000000000"
leg = "00000000000000000000000000000000"
name = "00000000000000000000000000000000"
```

- **No authored texture-name fields in exports**: the five 16-byte names are derived
  at compile time from the textures actually present in the kit folder (`kit.dds` →
  `u0{team_id}{slot}`, `kit_back.dds` → `…_back`, and so on) — one less thing to
  desync, and the reason an export config can't reference a missing texture anymore.
  Standalone binary → TOML conversion is the exception: because it has no team/slot/
  folder context from which to rederive the original bytes, it preserves imported
  names in an optional source-only `[source_texture_names]` table. Export-folder mode
  and the Team compiler ignore that table and always rederive names from actual files.
- **Version-neutral**: the TOML stores plain values; the version-specific bit
  packing (Name Y, PES15 pattern) is applied when emitting binary. A value that
  doesn't fit the target version (Name Y 30 for PES ≤20, whose field is 0–16) is a
  compile/check warning (`kit_value_out_of_range`, naming the field, the value and the
  version's maximum) and is clamped to that maximum on emission; one table of per-field,
  per-version maxima drives both the finding and the clamp, so they cannot disagree. The
  same finding covers every packed field (number sizes, positions, spacing, collar and
  badge coordinates), whose maximum is the field's width.
- **Unknown bits** live in an `[unknown]` table keyed by byte offset, holding the
  byte's undecoded-bit remainder (known bits zeroed). Known fields plus `[unknown]`
  round-trip bit-identically; the derived texture-name region is excluded from that
  guarantee in export mode. Standalone CLI conversion is fully bit-identical when it
  carries the optional `[source_texture_names]` table described above. Keys equal to
  the template default are omitted, so hand-written configs never need `[unknown]`.

## `libs/kit_config`

The format knowledge as a lib crate:

- `KitConfig` struct ↔ 120-byte binary (per-version encode/decode) ↔ TOML, including
  optional raw source texture-name bytes for standalone roundtrips; zlib'd input is
  tolerated on read (`tryDecompress` behavior carried over).
- The template defaults (from the bundled `XXX_DEF_xxx_realUni.bin` template) and
  `apply_fpc` / `matches_fpc`, used by the Team compiler's reconciliation
  (`kit_config_fpc_adjusted`) and by this tool's FPC indicator. The per-version FPC values
  themselves come from the leaf crate `libs/fpc` (see [libs](libs/README.md)), which also holds the
  player-side presets `pes_savefile` applies — one description of the system for every tool.
- Texture-name derivation from a kit's *effective* texture set (own files plus what it inherits
  from `Kits/all/`, as resolved by `aesthetics_export`) + team id + slot.
- Validation: range checks, cross-field constraints, version-fit warnings — one
  implementation for the editor's inline hints, the compiler's checks, and the CLI.

Consumers: this tool, `team_compiler` (generation, reconciliation, compile-time
emission), `export_upgrader` (binary → TOML migration). The Team compiler plan's
kit sections defer to this crate.

## GUI view

Two ways in, per the suite's export-first philosophy:

- **Open export folder** (primary): the `Kits/` subfolders appear as tabs
  (p1 … p9, g1), each titled with its folder name so a label (`p1 - Lakers`) shows; `all/` is
  not a tab. Each tab edits that kit's `config.toml` in place, and its texture-name
  section marks which of the five textures the kit inherits from `all/` (the derivation
  counts them exactly as the compiler does). The tool walks
  the selected source, supplies a canonical `vtree::ScopePath` listing and required
  small metadata to `aesthetics_export::parse_listing`, then consumes the resulting
  `ParsedAestheticsExport` plus kit-scoped validation—not a whole-export
  `ValidatedAestheticsExport`—so an unrelated roster/player error never prevents opening
  and repairing a kit. The shared crate still owns locating and
  validating the folders (see the [Team compiler plan](team_compiler/README.md)), so this
  tool never carries its own idea of the export layout. The same picker accepts a
  single loose file (`config.toml`, a game `.bin`, old-export configs).
- **Open UniformParameter bin** (secondary, via `uniparam`): lists the container's
  entries with a filter box; picking one edits it and saves back into the
  container — covers the cup keeper's "fix one team's config in the compiled bins"
  case without a compile round.

The form groups the fields as the format does — Shirt (models, collars, sleeves,
tight, pattern), Colors (the five config fields, via the shared `color_tools`
picker — no more JCPicker subprocess and hex-paste dance), Name, Numbers
(back/chest/shorts), Badges. Constraint gating is inline: options requiring shirt
model 144/160 gray out with a tooltip instead of the old modal error boxes. An FPC
indicator chip shows when the config carries the FPC values, linking the concept
to the Team compiler's reconciliation rather than leaving it as four magic numbers.

**Kit menu colors**: in export-folder mode each tab also edits the kit folder's
`colors.txt` (the two `UniColor.bin` menu colors that drive the match-UI
scoreboard and the kit-selection color dots) and its optional `icon.txt` (the
menu icon number, 0–23 — written only when it differs from the default 3, so the
file stays optional). Same picker, with its
suggestion swatches pre-loaded from `color_tools`' dominant-color extraction on
the kit's textures — the manager sees what the compiler would derive on its own
(its fallback when `colors.txt` is missing) and either accepts it with a click or
picks something better. Suggestions **preview live**: hovering a swatch (or
dragging inside the picker) temporarily applies the candidate color to everything
it tints — the menu-UI mockup and the icon gallery below — and reverts on
mouse-out, so a suggestion is judged in context before the click commits it. A
small **menu-UI mockup** sits next to the color fields, showing the two menu
colors as PES actually uses them: the kit-selection color-dot pair and a
scoreboard strip — not just bare swatches. The **icon is picked visually**: a gallery of all 24
kit icon patterns (`color_tools`' vector renditions — the `icon.txt` space,
not the config's Shirt pattern field), each tinted live with the
kit's current menu colors — never a bare number. A hint notes that only PES
15/16 display the icon in game (the prematch gameplan screens); the tinted
pattern still doubles as a preview of the menu colors themselves. Loose-file and
UniformParameter modes have no kit folder, so the section only appears when
editing inside an export.

**Preview panel**: a schematic shirt/shorts/socks drawing (egui painter) filled
with the config colors, overlaying markers for name arc, number positions, and
badge positions; when editing inside an export, the kit's actual textures
(`kit.dds` and variants, decoded via `dds_convert`) are composited under the
markers. Positions are relative — the game's exact pixel mapping is unknown, and
the old tool's 51MB of prerendered bitmaps is neither reusable nor worth
recreating; the preview is for orientation, the game remains the ground truth.

Unknown bits get a collapsible **raw view** row (hex per unknown region) for
curious users — the raw material for decoding the remaining bits someday.

## Settings (tool section)

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Show preview | on | |
| Show raw unknown-bits row | off | |

## CLI

```
studio kit-config-editor convert <in> <out>   # .bin ↔ .toml, direction by extension
studio kit-config-editor check <path>         # validate configs in an export / folder / container
```

## Testing

- **Roundtrips**: binary → model → binary bit-identical on the three real sample
  configs, the compiler template, and **every entry of the bundled
  `UniformParameter18/19.bin`** — hundreds of real configs exercising the full
  value space; decoded fields are also asserted against the documented ranges,
  which doubles as a check of the recovered format itself.
- **TOML roundtrips** including the `[unknown]` preservation path, export-mode derivation of texture
  names, and standalone CLI bit-identical preservation through `[source_texture_names]`.
- **Version encodings**: Name Y 5-bit/6-bit packing against configs saved by both
  Kit Manager variants; the PES15 pattern clamp against Red's behavior.
- **Manual**: edits made side-by-side in Kit Manager and this tool on the same file
  produce identical bytes.

## Improvements over Kit Manager (summary)

1. **The format is documented** — recovered once, written down here, implemented in
   an open lib instead of a dead closed-source exe.
2. **TOML configs in exports** — hand-editable, diffable, self-describing; binary
   only exists as a compile output and game-file import.
3. **Whole-team editing** — all of an export's kits in tabs, plus direct
   UniformParameter container editing; the original opened one file at a time.
4. **Live preview from the kit's real textures** instead of 51MB of canned bitmaps.
5. **Suite integration** — global PES version drives the encoding; FPC values are
   shared constants with the Team compiler, not folklore numbers; built-in color
   pickers with texture-derived suggestions.
6. **Kit menu colors in the same place** — each kit's `colors.txt` (UniColor menu
   colors) and `icon.txt` (menu icon, picked from a live-tinted visual gallery)
   are edited alongside its config, seeded by the same dominant-color extraction
   the compiler falls back on.

## Dropped features

- **Prerendered preview bitmaps** — replaced by the schematic + texture composite.
- **JCPicker integration** — replaced by the shared `color_tools` picker widget.

## Key decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Format knowledge | Recovered by disassembling Kit Manager v4 + diffing its PES2021 patch; documented in this plan | No sources or specs exist anywhere; the plan is now the reference |
| Export storage | `config.toml` per kit folder, compiled to binary at compile time | Same philosophy as `settings.toml`: text in exports, binary only as output; editable without the tool |
| Texture-name fields | Derived from kit-folder textures in export mode; optional raw `[source_texture_names]` preservation only for standalone binary conversion | Removes export desync while retaining bit-identical context-free CLI roundtrips |
| Unknown bits | Preserved via `[unknown]` table + optional raw view | Real configs have undecoded bits set; silent loss would corrupt them; the raw view aids future decoding |
| Version handling | Global PES version selector; version-neutral TOML, encode on emission | Matches the suite; the 2021 Name Y and PES15 pattern quirks are encoding details, not user concerns |
| Format logic placement | `libs/kit_config`, shared with Team compiler and Export upgrader | One crate owns the format; all consumers agree on validity (the core plan's lib-crate rule) |
| Preview | Schematic + real-texture composite, relative positions only | Honest about not knowing the game's exact mapping; avoids shipping megabytes of prerendered assets |
| Kit menu colors | Export-folder mode also edits each kit's `colors.txt` + `icon.txt`, with `color_tools` extraction as suggestions | One place for all per-kit menu data; shows the manager exactly what the compiler's fallback would pick |
| Extraction preview | Hover live-apply on suggestion swatches + a menu-UI mockup (color dots, scoreboard strip) | Auto-derived colors are judged in their in-game role before committing, not as isolated swatches |
| Menu icon storage | Own optional `icon.txt` per kit folder (0–23, absent = 3) | Fits neither `colors.txt` (it's not a color) nor `config.toml` (it's UniColor data, not kit-config data) |
