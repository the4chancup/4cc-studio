# 4cc Studio — Match tracker plan: Testing

Part of the [Match tracker plan](README.md). Section headings are unchanged from the single-file plan, so an existing pointer to a section still names it; only the file part of the pointer changed.

## Testing

- **Recorded-table replay**: a debug command dumps `RawTableSnapshot` fixtures from live
  games; the memory-source trait decodes them to `DecodedGameSnapshot` input through the
  same path as live reads. Event derivation, clock reconstruction, and phase
  transitions are asserted on recorded real matches (including extra time and
  penalty matches).
- **Acquisition validation fixtures**: a team-table candidate with 22 valid entries on only
  one side is rejected; 11 side-correct entries on each side are accepted; wrong-side
  validity markers, implausible team names, and player IDs inconsistent with the side's
  team ID are rejected.
- **Clock calibration unit tests**: synthetic tick sequences with known match lengths,
  stoppages, and injury time; stop/start debounce at the minimum and maximum supported
  poll rates, satisfying both the two-sample and profile elapsed-time thresholds.
- **Feed contract tests**: late-subscriber `SnapshotReplay` initialization without
  one-shot automation; an existing subscriber receiving
  `ScoreReconciled { reason: UnclassifiedGoalObserved }` and updating its uncertain score
  without automation; subscription immediately after that event receiving the updated
  unclassified score and record in its replay snapshot without triggering automation; a
  recovered aggregate unknown-domain goal appearing only in the next `MatchLive` or
  `MatchResumed` snapshot without a standalone `UnclassifiedGoalObserved` event; an
  automation-eligible resolving `Goal` or `OwnGoal` carrying the exact
  `UnclassifiedGoalId`, moving that record from uncertain to classified score without
  double-counting, while a `None` resolution ID adds a newly classified observation;
  `sequence: None` snapshots always processed
  and their cursor honored; rejection of
  publisher-originated `Snapshot`/`SnapshotReplay` and invalid
  provenance/event combinations; rejection of inconsistent `has_reached_live`,
  `score_authority`, lifecycle, and clock-motion combinations; rejection of snapshots
  whose unclassified score projection or `classification_complete` value disagrees with
  `unclassified_goals`; rejection of duplicate/out-of-cursor `UnclassifiedGoalId` values or
  a decreasing `next_unclassified_goal_id`; rejection of `PlayerKey` entries absent from the
matching same-side
  roster and participation entries whose `roster_index` identifies a different player;
  rejection of event or attribution `PlayerRef` values whose side, ID, or roster index
  disagrees with the enclosing side or snapshot roster; atomic snapshot cursor, immutable captured
`ClockWatch`, and both-
  lane registration under concurrent
  publish/watch replacement; initialization/reliable draining before the latest coalesced
  watch; atomic batch validation and sequence assignment, ordered transition snapshots,
  subscription exclusion during the batch, all-or-none enqueue, cursor advance, optional
  retained-snapshot install/clear, and required watch clearing; prepared-batch validation
  and match-ID-associated sequence reservation before file mutation, exclusion of publish,
  subscription, restore, and watch replacement while reserved, old-match cursor selection in
  a cross-match boundary batch, abort without sequence consumption on file failure, and
  infallible commit after durability; single-event wrapper parity;
  new-match sequence reset to 1, provisional same-match
  continuation, and rejection of illegal prior-state or `match_id` transitions; rejection
  of mismatched embedded and retained snapshots/scores; abandonment and `FeedReleased`
  observed by existing subscribers while later subscribers start `Idle`; successful
  recovery restore plus cursor continuation above the restored value, including a saved
  `Live` snapshot normalized to source-loss `Suspended` before a legal `MatchResumed`;
  reliable events
  never dropped; `TeamsDetected` performing setup without score authority, `MatchLive`
  acquiring it, and mid-match reacquisition seeding the score; source-loss suspension
  retaining consumer state and eligible pending metadata; user-stop canceling pending
  automation; user-stop, abandonment, finalization, and feed release returning to manual
  score accounting; `MatchResumed` reconciliation accepted from a suspended snapshot that
  has reached live and rejected from one that has not, with the latter using `MatchLive`
  for its first valid live snapshot; recovered historical events not triggering live
  automation; a recovered substitution appearing
  once in history and never being applied twice to participation state; `match_id`/
  reliable-sequence deduplication after reacquisition; the sequence returned by a successful
  `Goal` publish being used by its later `GoalAmended`; assist-only and kind-only
  `GoalAmended` payloads retaining the original goal clock and complete optional-assist/kind
  state while updating history without scoring or automation; a subscriber attaching between the
  goal and amendment using the complete amendment payload without triggering automation;
  `ScoreReconciled { reason: ClassificationResolved }` updating state without one-shot
  automation for post-boundary live records, recovered/restored records, and resolved
  attribution/domain combinations with no automation-eligible feed event; a late
  subscriber receiving scorer, disciplinary, participation, and team-loading state; a provisional
  correction or new match replacing slots loaded automatically for an earlier feed team
  while retaining a manual load and reporting its mismatch; Undo, per-team Reset, and team
  load/reload leaving authoritative score, scorer, discipline, and participation state
  unchanged; late subscription during source-loss suspension retaining paused feed authority
  and during user-stop suspension restoring manual score accounting from snapshot state
  alone; Autopilot `Off` suppressing playback/highlights without restoring manual scoring;
  `ClockStopped`
  propagating its `stop_epoch` to an existing subscriber and preserving pending automation
  through suspension/resume only when `MatchResumed` reports that same stopped epoch; a
  restart/stop cycle hidden inside a source-loss interval changing the stop epoch or
  reconciling clock motion to `Unknown` and canceling the pending horn; announcement
  deadlines using the original monotonic observation anchor; `WireClock` conversion
  including `observation_age_ms` exactly when that anchor exists and never serializing
  `observation_instant`; a disk-restored
  `UnclassifiedGoal` in `Pending` state with no monotonic anchor using reconciliation only
  and never triggering automation; batch preparation failure leaving reducer, broker, and
  authoritative file state unchanged, consuming no sequence, and exposing no part of the
  batch; lifecycle/result-state mismatches
  being rejected atomically; stale same-match restore rejection, exact idempotent same-match
  restore, `u64::MAX` cursor rejection, and concurrent restore/subscription; finalized
  matches releasing score authority without stopping audio or triggering victory
  automation; `FeedReleased` releasing authority and clearing broker state without
  abandoning the offline draft; `ClockWatch` initial replay, wakeups, coalescing, match-ID
  rejection, clearing, and independent revisions under load.
- **Match lifecycle tests**: same-team rematch detection through both the readiness chain
  and the scan-only table-loss/reallocation fallback; a validated different-team boundary
  after `Live` preparing/reserving the broker batch, durably writing the prospective final
  revision, infallibly publishing the old `MatchFinalized`, clearing the old watch in the
  new-match transition, and publishing
  `TeamsDetected` with a new `match_id`; a boundary write failure publishing neither
  `MatchFinalized` nor replacement `TeamsDetected`, retaining the prior lifecycle and
  recovery marker plus the detected replacement-team state, then a successful retry
  publishing the ordered atomic boundary batch; source progression during the blocked
  interval being excluded from the old match and causing the new match's recovered state
  and `history_complete` to reflect anything missed before retry; a team-identity change
  while provisional replacing the existing `TeamsDetected` draft without finalizing an
  empty match; a provisional `TeamsDetected` draft disabling Finish; discarding that feed-
  bound draft publishing `MatchAbandoned`, clearing retained snapshot/watch state, and
  suppressing immediate recreation from the same source session; transient read failure
  vs. finalized match; Finish and Discard while the
  source session remains live (the terminal `match_id` receives no more deltas and the same
  session cannot create another draft);
  PES-version change publishing `FeedReleased` and detaching an incompatible suspended
  draft, retaining its Offline draft tab while a new feed-bound Current Match becomes
  active, followed by offline save/finalize/discard without further feed publication;
  unknown score-domain goals remaining visible in `Score.unclassified` through snapshot
  replay without triggering automation, then moving atomically by stable record ID when
  classified; normal and own-goal attributions projecting onto the benefiting/scoring side,
  with an unknown-domain own goal preserving its conceding player and emitting `OwnGoal`
  only after regulation-domain classification; multiple `unclassified_goals` records
  retaining distinct IDs, attribution, scorer/clock evidence, and state through save/restore;
  classification before the post-goal boundary publishing an ordinary
  `Goal`, versus classification after a closing boundary while the record remains
  `Pending` publishing only `ScoreReconciled`; one pending record classified into
  regulation and another into shootout with only the regulation classification updating
  ordinary `scorer_counts`; an early `Pending` → `Permanent` transition publishing
  `ScoreReconciled { reason: ClassificationBecamePermanent }`; unresolved `Pending`
  records becoming `Permanent` through a reconciliation in the same atomic batch
  immediately before `MatchFinalized`; legitimate gauge/state decreases and
  `UnknownScalar` changes being accepted while only verified monotonic-counter decreases
  invoke invalid-read/reset handling; two goals or goal+assist/goal-kind evidence spanning
  adjacent polls; late assist or kind evidence amending before kickoff and being rejected
  after a phase or other amendment-closing boundary; closure of an initial goal holdback
  flushing every confirmed known-domain goal or materializing an unknown-domain record
  without discarding its delta; yellow-first
  and red-first second-yellow
  correlation, timeout, and phase/suspension boundary closure, all retaining the first
  delta's clock and never dropping a confirmed card; penalty and shootout score separation;
  clock stop/start debounce.
- **File format tests**: malformed, future-version, and oversized match files; canonical
  amended-goal materialization; profile field-class, `has_reached_live`, latest clock,
  optional timed `display_minute` versus shootout `None`, observed/reconstructed optional
  `Clock.seconds` and `InjuryTime.seconds` versus recorded-minute `None`, non-serialized
  `observation_instant`, and `ClockMotion`/`stop_epoch` round-trips; `score_authority`
  round-trips in ordinary and
  recovery files; ordinary read-only Open treating recorded authority as historical data
  without installing feed authority; recovery-only feed-binding-state round-trips;
  `PlayerKey`-keyed scorer, discipline, and participation maps round-tripping through
  ordinary and recovery files; multiple `unclassified_goals` records with stable IDs,
  scored/own-goal attribution, `Pending`/`Permanent` state, unclassified totals,
  `classification_complete`, and a non-reusing `next_unclassified_goal_id` cursor surviving
  save/restore; a restored
  `UnclassifiedGoal` in `Pending` state lacking a monotonic anchor and remaining ineligible
  for one-shot automation regardless of UTC or apparent stopped-window state;
  recovery-file discovery, cursor-preserving restore, and marker cleanup; prepared broker
  reservation followed by atomic conversion of an active recovery marker to `offline_only`
  and infallible profile-change `FeedReleased` commit, including preparation/conversion
  failure, crash/interruption cases, and rejection of feed Restore for the released
  `match_id`; Finish with no prior timed save, suspension,
  recovery file, or user save creating a durable finalized safety copy; write interruption
  retaining the draft and existing marker; atomic autosave interruption; optional 140-cell
  heatmap round-trip and absence, dimension/size rejection, and confirmation that heatmap
  changes do not create a hidden generic-stat grid timeline; worst-case JSON size and
  autosave latency for a full 120-minute match.
- **Cross-platform compilation**: Windows native plus non-Windows/WASM file-viewer
  build (Start tracking disabled, file viewing enabled).
- **Manual**: a full simulated stream with the music player on autopilot (shared with
  the music player's test plan).

### Verifying source-derived findings

The suite's first implementation targets PES 2017, so verification is prioritized
accordingly. Unresolved PES17 claims from either source are verified for the first release;
PES21 claims from the unofficial fork are **deferred** until PES21 support is pursued and
recorded here as a starting point for that future work. A claim that fails verification is
dropped, and the affected plan text reverts.

**PES17 verification required before first release:**

Each task must reach a recorded pass/fail decision before release. Failure disables the
affected optional capability or fast path but does not block the scan-based tracker itself.
Phase verification is a release gate only if first-release ET/shootout classification and
automation remain promised.

- **PES17 phase buckets**: the original confirms buckets 0–2 as the first half and 3–5
  as the second half, but only hypothesizes `1st ET: [6-7?], 2nd ET: [7?-8?]` and leaves
  segment 8 as a TODO (`MatchReader.cpp:171`). Capture and label all nine segments across
  regulation, both extra-time periods, and a shootout. Confirm the 6/7/8 mapping and
  transition behavior before enabling shootout classification or ET/penalty-phase
  automation; until then those buckets remain unregistered and produce `Phase::Unknown`.
- **PES17 heatmap grid**: the original maps the "Play Area Grid" at entry+0x1034
  (`StatsInfo.cpp:150`, 140×u32) and processes it only through the generic stat path as a
  summed scalar column, hidden by default; it never interprets or renders the 10x14 grid as
  a heatmap. Confirm that the underlying 140 cells — not merely their generic aggregate —
  populate with stable spatial semantics during a live PES17 match (values update as
  players move), determine 10×14 orientation and whether sides/halves require flipping,
  and whether values are cumulative or instantaneous. If it is confirmed to populate with
  stable semantics, PES17 heatmap recording and the viewer ship in the first release;
  otherwise the viewer remains hidden for PES17 and the signature is not registered.
- **PES17 pointer-chain locator (fast path)**: the fork's profile defines two chains
  from the same root: `root = *(moduleBase + 0x21A9E68)`. The **readiness chain** is
  `container = *(root + 0x124)`, `flag = *(u32 *)(container + 0x1168)`; `flag == 0` claims
  that a match is live. The **stats-base chain** is `subObj = *(root + 0x2890)`,
  `stats-table base = subObj + 0x317FC`; the last step is arithmetic, not a dereference.
  The operational fork does not use this profile in its PES17 `findStats()` path.
  Confirm that applying the profile's `+0x3804` player-array offset to the resolved base
  yields the same home stat-entry address found by the original scan, that the derived
  away address also agrees, and that the readiness flag distinguishes live/not-live. If
  it holds, PES17 gains the ASLR-proof fast path described under "Acquisition and
  polling"; if not, the scan-only path stands.

**Low priority (PES21, deferred until PES21 support is pursued):**

- **Pointer-chain stats-table locator (PES21)**: same two-chain structure. The readiness
  chain is `root = *(moduleBase + 0x36F4178)`, `container = *(root + 0)`,
  `flag = *(u32 *)(container + 0)`; `flag == 0` claims that a match is live. The stats-base
  chain is `subObj = *(root + 0xBD08)`, `stats-table base = subObj + 0x750D0`. Confirm both
  on a live PES 2021 (1.01).
- **PES21 stat layout**: confirm entry size 8500 and indicator validation (0xFFFD/0xFFFE
  at +0, ID at +4). Normalize the fork's declared 269-slot catalog into unique Studio
  `catalog_id` values: account for all 263 explicit initializers and six default slots,
  bounds-check every offset/type/count against the entry size, and explicitly resolve or
  reject duplicate IDs, overlapping aliases, and conflicting definitions — including the
  duplicate `visualIndex` ranges 110–134 and 176–185 — before enabling them. Confirm the
  physical 40-slot layout and capture a roster using slots 32–39. The
  suite must use dynamically sized vectors or the profile maximum of 40 throughout; the
  fork's 32-slot `teamInfo` structures are not reusable. Cross-check a sample of named
  stats (Goals, Cards, Saves, Minutes, Rating) against observed match events.
- **Substitution journal (unverified)**: verify the fork's claimed `u8` count at
  `table_base + 0x10B4D4` (maximum 12) and 40-byte record `i` at
  `table_base + 0x10B2F4 + 40*i`, with `type` at `+0`, `team` at `+4`, `period` at `+8`,
  `minute_in_period` at `+12`, `inIdx` at `+20`, and `outIdx` at `+24`. Confirm that the
  indices match the actual substitution, the recorded period/minute is exact, and the
  restart-replay behavior holds across a tracker restart mid-match.
- **Direct clock read (unverified)**: verify the fork's claimed chain
  `manager = *(u64 *)(moduleBase + 0x3705E10)`,
  `clock_object = *(u64 *)(manager + 0x50)`, the `u32` segment at
  `clock_object + 0x3FCD4`, and the `f32` ticks at `clock_object + 0x3FCD8`. Confirm that
  segment/ticks reproduce the scoreboard minute + injury time across all phases and into
  extra time. Also verify tick stagnation and resumption across ordinary stoppages, goal
  celebrations/replays, halftime, and menus, and confirm that a unique post-goal restart
  can be derived before enabling PES21 autopilot.
- **PES21 heatmaps**: confirm the 140×u32 player grid at entry+0x1938 and the 8 per-team
  grids populate during a match. Determine the meaning of all 8 grids, validate the
  fork's five-segment accumulation and odd-segment flipping, and establish whether values
  are cumulative before exposing or serializing them.
