# 4cc Studio — Library crates plan: fox2

Part of the [Library crates plan](README.md). Section headings are unchanged from the single-file plan, so an existing pointer to a section still names it; only the file part of the pointer changed.

## `libs/fox2`: Fox Engine entity files

A `.fox2` is the Fox Engine's serialized entity graph (a stadium's models, lights, audience and
staff placements), shipped inside FPKD archives; the Stadium compiler compiles generated XML to
`.fox2` and rewrites stadium IDs inside Konami's by decompiling to XML, editing the text and
compiling back. The reference is a Python port of the C# FoxTool; its XML is the interchange
format the stadium exports already carry (`*.fox2.xml`), so the crate speaks both. Layout
measured on the 87 distinct `.fox2` inside the 108 FPKDs on the writing machine (Konami PES 16
stadium, audience, staff, light and boots files); the fixtures under
`crates/libs/fox2/tests/fixtures/` are four of them covering every data type and container that
occurs. Everything little-endian.

- **Header, 32 bytes**: `u32 0x786F62F2`, `u32 0x35`, `i32 entity_count`,
  `i32 string_table_offset`, `i32 32` (header size), 12 zero bytes.
- **Entities**, back to back from offset 32. Each has a 64-byte header: `i16 64` (header size),
  `i16 unknown1` (values 64 to 560 in steps that look like class sizes; carried), `i16 0`,
  `u32 0x746E65` (`ent`), `u32 address` (an in-engine pointer, unique per entity, referenced by
  `EntityPtr`/`EntityHandle` values), `u32 0`, `i32 unknown2` (0 in all 6957 entities; carried),
  `i32 0`, `i16 version`, `u64 class_name_hash`, `u16 static_count`, `u16 dynamic_count`,
  `i32 64` (offset), `i32 static_data_size` (entity start to the end of the static properties),
  `i32 data_size` (entity start to the end of the dynamic ones), zero-padded from 52 to 64. Then
  the static properties, then the dynamic ones (no file on the machine has any).
- **Property**: a 32-byte header `u64 name_hash, u8 data_type, u8 container, u16 count,
  u16 32, u16 size` (the whole property, header and padding included), 16 zero bytes; then the
  values, then zero padding to 16. A `StringMap` (container 2) stores each entry as
  `u64 key_hash`, the value, padding to 16; `StaticArray` 0, `DynamicArray` 1 and `List` 3 store
  the values back to back.
- **Data types** (word, size in bytes): int8 0 (1), uint8 1 (1), int16 2 (2), uint16 3 (2),
  int32 4 (4), uint32 5 (4), int64 6 (8), uint64 7 (8), float 8 (4), double 9 (8), bool 10 (1),
  String 11, Path 12 and FilePtr 20 (8: a string hash), EntityPtr 13 and EntityHandle 21 (8),
  Vector3 14, Vector4 15, Quat 16 and Color 19 (16: four `f32`, Vector3 included), Matrix3 17
  (36), Matrix4 18 (64), EntityLink 22 (32: package, archive and name hashes then a `u64`
  handle), WideVector3 24 (16: three `f32`, two `u16`). PropertyInfo 23 has no known layout and
  is a read error. Seen on the machine: float, EntityHandle, Vector3, bool, EntityPtr, int32,
  EntityLink, uint32, String, Quat, Color, uint8, FilePtr, Path, Vector4; the rest are
  implemented from the reference and untested against a real file, and the doc says so.
- **Strings are hashes**: `hash_string(text)` is CityHash64WithSeeds over `text + NUL` with
  `seed0 = 0x9AE16A3B2F90404F` and `seed1 = (first_byte << 16) + len(text)`, masked to 48 bits;
  the CityHash is the 1.0.3 variant the C# tool embeds (`HashLen0to16`, `17to32`, `33to64`,
  `above64`), ported directly, not taken from a crate whose version cannot be pinned to that
  variant. Verified by `hash_golden.tsv` (reference hashes for 46 strings across every length
  class, the empty string and non-ASCII) and by every fixture's own string table.
- **String table** at `string_table_offset`: entries `u64 hash, u32 len, bytes` until a zero
  hash; then zero padding to 16, the five bytes `00 00 'e' 'n' 'd'`, zero padding to 16, end of
  file. Konami's table holds every string the file hashes except the empty string (hash
  `0xB8A0BF169F98`, which occurs as a value and which the reference resolves only through its
  dictionary's empty first line); its order varies per file (byte-sorted in some, traversal
  order in others). The compiler writes the table in entity-traversal order (class name,
  property names, keys and values as met), deduplicated, empty literals skipped, which is the
  reference's order and what `*.compiled.fox2` holds.
- **Reference quirk not reproduced**: the Python writer returns its over-allocated buffer, so
  its output carries hundreds of trailing zero bytes past the `end` trailer (896 bytes of content
  in a 1228-byte result). FoxTool's and Konami's files end at the aligned trailer; ours do too,
  and the compiled goldens are the reference output cut there.

Types, copied by the implementation:

```rust
pub struct Fox2File { pub entities: Vec<Entity>, pub string_table: Vec<TableEntry> }
pub struct TableEntry { pub hash: u64, pub text: String }
pub struct Entity {
    pub class_name: FoxString, pub unknown1: i16, pub unknown2: i32, pub version: i16,
    pub address: u32, pub static_properties: Vec<Property>, pub dynamic_properties: Vec<Property>,
}
pub struct Property { pub name: FoxString, pub container: Container, pub keys: Vec<FoxString>, pub values: Values }
pub enum FoxString { Literal(String), Hash(u64) }   // `hash()` hashes a literal, returns a hash as is
pub enum Container { StaticArray = 0, DynamicArray = 1, StringMap = 2, List = 3 }
pub enum Values {                                    // one variant per data type, `data_type()` gives the word

pub struct WideVector3 { pub x: f32, pub y: f32, pub z: f32, pub a: u16, pub b: u16 }

```

`Fox2File::read(&[u8])` keeps every string as `Hash` and the table as read, so `write()` is
byte-identical on every Konami file (the entity region and the table alike). `resolve(&mut self,
dictionary: Option<&Dictionary>)` turns hashes into `Literal`s through the file's own table
first, then the dictionary, leaving unknown hashes as they are. `to_xml(&self) -> String` writes
the FoxTool layout: two-space indent, `<fox formatVersion="2" fileVersion="0"
originalVersion="">`, a `<classes>` list of `Entity`, `Data`, then each class as first met with
its entity's version, `<entities>` with `class classVersion addr unknown1 unknown2`,
`<staticProperties>`/`<dynamicProperties>` holding `<property name type container arraySize>`
and `<value>` children; a `Literal` is element text (`<value></value>` for the empty string), a
`Hash` the attribute `hash="0x%08X"`; integers decimal, floats in C#'s round-trip text (the
shortest of 7 and 9 significant digits that reads back to the same `f32`, `E+NN`/`E-NN`
exponents, `-0`; `float_golden.tsv` holds 36 reference cases), doubles likewise at 17 digits,
bools `true`/`false`, pointers, handles and `addr` `0x%08X`, Vector3/Vector4/Quat as `x y z w`
attributes, Color `r g b a`, Matrix3/4 as `<RowN ColumnM="..">` children, EntityLink as
`packagePath archivePath nameInArchive` attributes (`...Hash` when unresolved) with the handle
as text, WideVector3 `x y z a b`. Attribute escaping `& " <` plus tab, LF and CR as `&#9;`
`&#10;` `&#13;` (an XML reader normalizes raw ones to spaces, which would change the string and
so its hash); text escaping `& < >` and CR. Where the reference's XML is lossy, ours is not: an
unresolved class or property name prints as the reference's `class=""`/`name=""` *and* a
`classHash`/`nameHash` attribute with the hash, which `from_xml` prefers when present, so a
Konami file whose names the dictionary lacks survives a decompile/compile round trip instead of
being recompiled with the empty-string hash (the reference's behavior, which the Stadium
compiler's ID rewrite would otherwise inherit). A `StringMap` key literal is ambiguous with a
hash when it starts with `0x`; the format has no way around that, no file on the machine has
one, and `from_xml` reads `0x` followed by hex as a hash and anything else as a literal.
`Fox2File::from_xml(&str)` reads that layout with `roxmltree` (missing attributes default as the
reference's do: `0`, `""`, container `StaticArray`; a `bool` must read `true`, `false` or empty,
anything else is an error rather than the reference's silent `false`) and builds the string table
in traversal order. The binary reader validates every padding span it skips (property tails,
`StringMap` entries, the trailer) as zero, since a rewrite zero-fills them; measured true on all
87 files, whose trailers also all end exactly at the file end. The XML text produced by decompiling each fixture without a dictionary equals the
reference's (`*.fox2.xml`), with a one-line dictionary (`audi_low_parts.dict.fox2.xml`) too; the
binary compiled from each equals `*.compiled.fox2`. The dictionary file itself (1.7 MB, 21543
lines) is the Stadium compiler's asset, placed when that tool is built; the lib only loads one.
