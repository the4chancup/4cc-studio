# 4cc Studio — Refs arranger plan

The Refs arranger (`crates/tools/refs_arranger`, tool id `refs-arranger`, sidebar
label "Refs arranger") replaces the spreadsheet workflow the cup staff currently
uses to decide which referees appear in matches. It edits two files inside a refs
export: the slot allocation (`players.txt`), and — on Fox versions, where the
community's `fox_hook` runtime can override the game's referee draw — the **referee
lists** (`ref_lists.txt`) that the hook's script applies per match. Where the draw
cannot be overridden (PES 15–17, or Fox without the hook) it falls back to shaping
the draw statistically, against each PES version's measured slot appearance rates,
with drag-and-drop assignment and live appearance-chance feedback. It then hands the
compile itself off to the [Team compiler](team_compiler/README.md), which already owns
referee compilation. It is deliberately **not** a compiler — see "Why an arranger,
not a compiler". Platform context is in the [core plan](core/README.md).

The tool consumes `libs/aesthetics_export` (the export object model, folder conventions,
and `players.txt` slot mapping — see "Player numbering" and "Referee export
processing" in the Team compiler plan).

---

## Background

Every PES version has **35 referee slots** (`referee001`–`referee035`); each match
uses three referees (one main referee, two linesmen) drawn from those slots.
Filling all 35 with distinct models is overkill, so ~8 models are repeated across
the slots, with each model's repetition count determining how frequently that
referee appears. The mapping lives in the refs export's root `players.txt`: up to
35 slot entries, each naming a player folder, with the same folder free to appear
under any number of slots.

The catch is that **the slots are not drawn uniformly**, and the drawing mechanism
differs by engine generation:

- **PES 17–21**: measurements give per-slot marginal appearance rates, not independent
  draws or joint probabilities. Some slots are hot (16–18 appear in ~15–17% of measured
  matches each), some were rarely or never observed (11–15 and 26–30 at ~0%). A fixed
  weighted list is the intended workflow; the measured rates remain estimates.
- **PES 15/16**: the game picks a whole **pattern** — a fixed triple of slot numbers
  (upper linesman, main referee, lower linesman) — from a small set with very uneven
  probabilities. The dominant pattern (slots 17-8-5) covers almost a quarter of all
  matches, so a fixed assignment would show the same trio constantly. Referees must
  be **rotated across slots on a matchday basis** to spread appearances.

Until now this was managed in a spreadsheet: a pattern table where names are pasted
into cells (with bold marking the writable first occurrence of each slot and
background colors pairing the derived repeats), a storage list of available
referees, and a derived 35-entry column ready to be copied into the txt. The
arranger replaces that spreadsheet, keeps the math, and writes the file itself.

### The Fox referee hook

On PES 18–21 the draw can be overridden. `fox_hook` (`Tools_4cc/fox_hook`: a `dinput8.dll`
that runs Lua scripts inside the Fox games' embedded engine, with a sider-compatible API)
ships `03_refmod.lua`, a trampoline on the game's **referee slot-writer** — the routine the
game calls once per match position, `slot 0..4`, with the referee id it drew (0..35). So a
Fox match has **five** referee positions, not three: main referee, two linesmen, and — to be
confirmed by forcing ids in-game — the fourth official and the substitution-board holder. The
hook offers two primitives, settable from Lua at any time and persistent across script reloads:

| Primitive | State | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Force** | five ids + an on/off flag | position *i* receives `force[i]` whatever the game drew (a forced 0 falls through to remap) |
| **Remap** | 36-entry table, identity by default | the drawn id is replaced by `remap[drawn]` |

The pattern scan covers PES 2018, 2019 and 2021; **PES 2020 is taken to match 2021**. The
runtime's match context exposes the home and away team ids and a per-frame tick, so a
companion script can re-set the force table whenever a new match starts; it exposes no stadium
(not needed — per-match control is the requirement). Nothing in the hook reads a file today:
the file the arranger writes and the script that consumes it are the contract defined below,
the reading side being the hook author's to implement.

What this changes: with the hook, **which referee appears is decided in Lua, not by which of
35 slots the game happens to draw**. Each referee needs only one slot; the weighting-by-
repetition problem disappears on Fox and, with it, the "recompile the refs CPK before every
matchday" loop — rotation is a text file the script reads. The measured rates below remain the
tool's engine for PES 15–17, and the *fallback fill* for Fox users who play without the file.

**Who gets the file.** The hook installs with forcing **off** and the remap table at identity,
and nothing but an explicit `set`/`force` call turns forcing on — so a game with the hook but no
lists file draws referees exactly as an unmodified game does. That is the distribution model:
the lists file goes to the **streamers**, with one list per match of the matchday in schedule
order, so the broadcast shows the referees the staff chose; everyone else receives nothing and
gets the game's own draw over the fallback-filled `players.txt`. The same CPK serves both. (One
consequence of the hook's design for the companion script: force state persists across script
reloads within a game session, so the script must call `force_off()` when it finds no file —
otherwise a file loaded and then removed keeps forcing until the game restarts.)

## Slot appearance rates (reference data)

These tables are empirical measurements, embedded as per-version constants. They drive
the PES 15–17 editors and the Fox fallback fill. They can be refined as more matches
are logged; the sample sizes are given so future measurements can be merged sensibly.

### PES 17–21: flat per-slot rates

Measured over 125 matches (three referee appearances per match; rate = matches in
which the slot appeared / 125):

| Slot | Matches | Rate | | Slot | Matches | Rate | | Slot | Matches | Rate |
|------|---------|------|-|------|---------|------|-|------|---------|------|
| 1 | 8 | 6.4% | | 13 | 1 | 0.8% | | 25 | 16 | 12.8% |
| 2 | 18 | 14.4% | | 14 | 0 | 0.0% | | 26 | 0 | 0.0% |
| 3 | 11 | 8.8% | | 15 | 1 | 0.8% | | 27 | 0 | 0.0% |
| 4 | 14 | 11.2% | | 16 | 21 | 16.8% | | 28 | 0 | 0.0% |
| 5 | 11 | 8.8% | | 17 | 19 | 15.2% | | 29 | 0 | 0.0% |
| 6 | 14 | 11.2% | | 18 | 21 | 16.8% | | 30 | 1 | 0.8% |
| 7 | 15 | 12.0% | | 19 | 8 | 6.4% | | 31 | 13 | 10.4% |
| 8 | 12 | 9.6% | | 20 | 17 | 13.6% | | 32 | 12 | 9.6% |
| 9 | 17 | 13.6% | | 21 | 14 | 11.2% | | 33 | 13 | 10.4% |
| 10 | 15 | 12.0% | | 22 | 18 | 14.4% | | 34 | 16 | 12.8% |
| 11 | 0 | 0.0% | | 23 | 14 | 11.2% | | 35 | 14 | 11.2% |
| 12 | 0 | 0.0% | | 24 | 18* | 14.4%* | | | | |

\* Slot 24's count is marked uncertain in the source measurements (see Open
questions). The counts sum to **372**, not the **375** implied by 125 matches with
three appearances each. Preserve the supplied observations, but flag the table as
incomplete pending reconciliation; do not silently renormalize it or assign the
three missing appearances to slot 24.

Slots 11–15 and 26–30 are effectively dead (≤0.8%); assigning anything but the
filler to them is wasted weight.

### PES 15/16: pattern table

The game draws one of these (upper, main, lower) slot triples per match. Measured
over 64 matches:

| Upper | Main | Lower | Matches | Rate |
|-------|------|-------|---------|------|
| 17 | 8 | 5 | 15 | 23.44% |
| 5 | 22 | 25 | 14 | 21.88% |
| 7 | 25 | 17 | 12 | 18.75% |
| 3 | 7 | 4 | 8 | 12.50% |
| 20 | 2 | 33 | 8 | 12.50% |
| 25 | 22 | 5 | 2 | 3.13% |
| 9 | 24 | 7 | 2 | 3.13% |
| 25 | 7 | 17 | 2 | 3.13% |
| 19 | 16 | 18 | 1 | 1.56% |

Only **16 distinct slots** appear across the patterns (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 33); the other 19 slots essentially never show and take the
filler. Note that a slot keeps one referee across all its pattern occurrences —
slot 25 appearing in four cells is still one assignment — and that slots are not
role-bound (slot 7 appears as upper, main, and lower in different patterns).

## Why an arranger, not a compiler

The Team compiler **already compiles refs exports**: a `refs`-prefixed export routes
through its pipeline as `ExportIdentity::Referees`, with numeric ID 999 rendered only
at game-format boundaries (999 is not a normal 701–920 `TeamId`) and slot-mapped
packing (see "Referee export processing" in the [Team compiler plan](team_compiler/blue_port.md)). A "Refs
compiler"
tool owning its own compile step would add no compilation behavior — it would only
need to *trigger* one, and since tool crates must not depend on tool crates (core
plan, workspace guardrail 1), that would force extracting the compilation engine
(~80% of the Team compiler crate: pipeline, processing, packing, message catalog,
settings ownership) into a lib crate with exactly one thin extra consumer. That is
guardrail 3's over-splitting warning sign, and the convenience it buys is one saved
click. Rejected; the engine split stays available along the blessed logic-vs-view
seam if a substantial second consumer ever appears (see "No per-tool companion libs"
in the core plan).

The handoff instead rides on machinery that already exists:

1. **Save** writes `players.txt` into the refs export under the exports folder.
2. The Team compiler's **folder watcher** picks the change up like any file edit and
   revalidates the refs row immediately.
3. The **"Save & open in Team compiler"** button saves (if unsaved) and asks the
   shell to switch the active tool (`ctx.switch_to_tool("team-compiler")` — an
   id-string request to `ToolContext`, no crate dependency; see "Tool plugin
   interface" in the core plan). The user presses Compile there.

A `match_feed`-style injected compile-request channel (for a true one-click
Save & Compile) was considered and deferred: it can be added later without moving
any code, and the manual switch costs a single click.

Hence the name: the tool arranges, the compiler compiles.

## The tool

The arranger reads the refs export from the common `exports_folder_path` (core plan). If multiple
non-disabled `refs`-prefixed exports are found, the arranger is inactive until the user resolves the
conflict (the Team compiler's Reader detects the conflict before validation and emits a Run summary
plus export-scoped `multiple_ref_exports` blockers for every conflicting row; the arranger shows a
notice pointing at them). `NO_USE`/`NO_USE.txt` sources are disabled and do not participate. Only
one plain-folder refs export can be edited at a time.

### Storage box

- Lists the referees found in the refs export: the player folders under `Players/`.
  The arranger performs its plain-filesystem walk, supplies the canonical
  `vtree::ScopePath` listing plus small metadata such as `players.txt` to
  `aesthetics_export::parse_listing`, and receives a `ParsedAestheticsExport`; it never reads
  model or texture payloads. The arranger deliberately does not require a `ValidatedAestheticsExport`:
  the roster may be missing, invalid, or partial — creating and repairing it is
  this tool's job; valid entries from an existing `players.txt` pre-populate the
  assignments, while its scoped issues remain visible.
- Each entry shows a version-appropriate **appearance estimate**:
  - **PES 15/16**: estimated chances of appearing as main referee and as linesman,
    separately — sum the observed rates of patterns in which the referee holds
    each kind of slot. Exact for the supplied sample, not a claim about the game's
    true probabilities.
  - **PES 17**: expected appearances per match — sum the assigned slots' marginal rates.
    Label this as an expected count, not a probability of appearing at least once; joint
    slot observations would be needed for the latter.
  - **PES 18–21**: appearances across the lists (how many lists, and in which positions),
    plus the fallback expected count from the filled `players.txt` in a secondary style,
    labelled "without the hook".
- One referee is designated the **Filler** (a dedicated drop target): on PES 15–17 it is
  auto-assigned to every slot not explicitly assigned, so all 35 slots are always covered
  and the written `players.txt` is always complete. On PES 18–21 there is no Filler: the
  leftover slots are filled by weighted repetition (see the Fox mode below).
- Entries are drag sources; dragging onto a slot row or a list position assigns (egui's
  built-in drag-and-drop: `dnd_drag_source` / `dnd_drop_zone`).

### Editor

The editor switches on the **global PES version selector** (sidebar), like every
version-dependent behavior in the suite:

- **PES 18–21 mode — lists.** The referee hook decides who appears, so the editor is
  about *lists*, and the slot mapping is derived:
  - **Home slots.** Every referee in the storage box holds exactly one slot, 1..N in
    storage-box order (reorderable by drag; the order is saved, so a referee's slot —
    which is its id in the lists — stays stable across sessions unless the user moves it).
    N ≤ 35; a 36th referee is refused with a notice.
  - **Lists.** A list is five positions (`0..4`, the order the game writes them; the role
    labels — main, linesmen, fourth official, board holder — are shown once the position
    roles are confirmed in-game, see Open questions), each holding one referee, **all five
    distinct** (the reason force lists are used rather than remap: collapsing 35 drawn ids
    onto N referees would regularly put the same model on the pitch twice). Lists are
    ordered; the script applies them per match in order (wrapping if the matchday runs
    longer than the file), so a file is **one matchday: list *k* is match *k* of the
    schedule**. A list may carry an optional `team=<id>` selector,
    which the script prefers for that team's matches when it can read the team ids; it is
    plain text the arranger round-trips and needs no UI beyond a field.
  - **Building lists**: by hand (drag referees into positions), or **Randomize** — *n*
    lists (*n* = the matchday's match count, asked for) such that every referee appears as
    evenly as possible per position across the set (round-robin over a shuffled order per
    position, then repaired for the five-distinct rule), which is what a person does with the
    spreadsheet by hand and gets wrong at list twelve. Undo covers it.
  - **Fallback fill.** Slots N+1..35 of `players.txt` are filled by **repeating the
    referees**, weighted by the PES 17–21 rate table so that each referee's expected
    appearances are as equal as the dead and hot slots allow — the previous engine, applied
    to the leftover slots only. This is what everyone without the lists file sees, i.e.
    everyone but the streamers, so it is the ordinary viewer's experience rather than an edge
    case; with a file loaded the fill is invisible, since force never lets the drawn slot
    through. The fill is automatic and shown read-only under the lists; no Filler referee
    exists in this mode.
- **PES 17 mode**: all 35 slots as editable rows — slot number, measured rate,
  drop target with the assigned name. Dead slots (~0%) render grayed (filler by
  default) but stay assignable. The slot list *is* the mapping; no preview needed.
  (The table was measured on the Fox side and is assumed to hold on 17 — see Open
  questions; if it does not, this mode gets its own measurement, not a different UI.)
- **PES 15/16 mode**: **slot list + pattern preview.**
  - The editor is one row per distinct pattern slot (16 rows), sorted by total
    weight, each showing the slot number, its overall appearance rate, its
    main-vs-linesman split (e.g. slot 7: main 15.6%, lines 21.9%), and the drop
    target. The 19 never-appearing slots are not listed — they take the filler.
  - Below it, a **read-only pattern preview**: the familiar Upper/Main/Lower ×
    pattern-rows table with assigned names filled in live and each row's match %.
  - **Hover cross-linking**: hovering a slot row highlights all its cells in the
    preview, and hovering a preview cell highlights its slot row.
  - This replaces the spreadsheet's colors+bold convention deliberately: that
    convention existed only because a spreadsheet must designate one writable cell
    per repeated slot and visually pair the derived copies. With the mapping edited
    slot-per-row, every assignment has exactly one editing surface — no
    writable/derived distinction, no 16-color pairing to scan; identity is shown on
    demand by the hover link.
- A **list panel** always shows the resulting 35 entries (the `players.txt` view,
  filler and fallback-fill entries grayed).
- A **Shuffle** button (PES 15–17) randomly permutes the referees currently assigned to
  slots across those same slots — a one-click rotation for the PES 15/16 matchday
  workflow. Unassigned referees stay in the storage box, the Filler stays on the
  unassigned slots, and the slot set is preserved (so a deliberately dead slot
  keeps its Filler). Undo restores the pre-shuffle assignment.

### The lists file (`ref_lists.txt`)

Written beside `players.txt`, copied by the cup staff into the hook's folder together with
the compiled CPK. Plain text, because the consumer is Lua 5.1 with `string.gmatch` and no
parser for anything richer, the arranger must read it back to edit it, and a line should be
fixable in Notepad on a match night — one format, one home, a few lines of parsing on each
side:

```
# ref_lists.txt — written by 4cc Studio Refs arranger
# one list per line: five referee slot ids, positions 0..4 as the game writes them
# optional selector after the ids: team=<id>; blank and # lines ignored
3 7 1 5 2
4 2 8 1 6
7 3 5 2 8 team=712
```

Grammar: five integers 1..35 separated by whitespace, then zero or more `key=value` tokens,
then an optional `#` comment. The arranger rejects a line with a repeated id or an id above
N with a scoped issue on load, and never writes one. The reading script is the hook author's
(read at init, apply with `ref_mod.set` when the match changes, advance the cursor; **no file →
`force_off()`**, so an absent file always means the game's own draw); the arranger's
responsibility ends at the file, and this grammar is the interface to agree on.

### Saving

Save writes `players.txt` into the refs export — and, on PES 18–21, `ref_lists.txt` beside
it — and nothing else: folders are never touched. `players.txt` uses the Team compiler
plan's canonical UTF-8/LF roster grammar. Each write uses a sibling temporary file, flush,
and atomic replace so folder watchers can never observe a half-written file. Overwriting an existing `players.txt` asks
for confirmation; creating one where none existed does not. A legacy `refs.txt`
(the read-only alias `aesthetics_export` accepts on referee exports — see "Player
numbering" in the Team compiler plan) pre-populates the assignments like a
`players.txt` would; on save it is removed after the new `players.txt` is in place,
with the same confirmation, so a successful save leaves only the canonical file. During the brief
transition both may exist; the compiler's documented `players.txt` precedence handles that state.
This is a deliberate, narrow exception to the "source exports are read-only" principle:
that rule binds the *compiler*
(auto-fixes stay in memory so submissions aren't altered); the arranger is an
export **editor**, like the Kit config editor editing kit folders inside exports —
editing the export is its purpose.

The refs export must be a **plain folder**: writing into `.zip`/`.7z` archives is
out of scope (an archived refs export shows a notice). In practice refs exports are
maintained by cup staff as folders.

### CLI

`studio refs-arranger chances ./exports/refs_export` — prints the
per-referee appearance estimates (and per-slot assignments), labeled as probability for PES 15/16
or expected count for PES 17–21 (on 18–21 additionally the per-list, per-position counts from
`ref_lists.txt`), derived from the export's current files, using the active PES version's table.

`studio refs-arranger randomize ./exports/refs_export --lists 12` — writes `ref_lists.txt`
with *n* randomized lists over the export's referees (same algorithm as the button; refuses
to overwrite without `--yes`), for the staff member who rotates from a script. Arrangement by
hand is GUI-only; drag-and-drop has no meaningful CLI analogue.

### Settings

None initially — the tool contributes an empty settings section. The rate tables
are constants, not settings.

## Matchday rotation

- **PES 18–21**: none at compile time. The CPK is compiled once per referee roster change.
  Before a matchday the staff produce that matchday's lists file — one list per match in
  schedule order — and send it to the streamers, who drop it into the hook's folder; nobody
  else receives anything. No recompile, no Studio required at the venue.
- **PES 15/16**: before each matchday, open the arranger, reshuffle names across the slot rows
  (guided by the chances in the storage box), save, switch to the Team compiler,
  recompile the refs CPK. A possible future helper — tracking cumulative appearances
  across saved lists and suggesting the next assignment that equalizes them — is
  noted but not part of the initial scope.

## Development phase

Phase 13 in the core plan's Development Plan. Small: the export knowledge already
lives in `libs/aesthetics_export`; the tool adds the rate-table constants, the slot-list
and lists editors, the chance math, the fallback fill, the two writers, and the handoff
button. Needs `aesthetics_export` (Phase 3) and the app shell (Phase 8).

Verification covers canonical `players.txt` roundtrip and chance math; `ref_lists.txt`
round-trip including selectors and comments; the randomizer's invariants (five distinct per
list, per-position counts differing by at most one across the set, an N < 5 roster refused with
a notice); the fallback fill (every referee in slots 1..N exactly once and in that order, slots
N+1..35 repeating referees with expected counts within the table's resolution of each other,
identical output for identical input); plus observed atomic replacement of an existing file:
interrupted temporary writes leave the old target intact, watcher reads see either the complete
old or complete new file but never a partial one, and replacement is exercised explicitly on
Windows.

## Open questions

- **Position roles on Fox.** Which of the hook's positions 0..4 is the main referee, which are
  the linesmen, and what the remaining two are (fourth official and substitution-board holder,
  presumably). Settled by forcing distinct ids into each position in a few matches; until then
  the lists editor labels positions by number.
- **The reading script.** Whether the embedded Lua can read a file directly or needs a DLL
  primitive is the hook author's side of the contract; it does not change the file.
- **Do PES 15 and 16 share one pattern table?** The measurements come from one of
  the two; assumed shared until measured on the other.
- **17–21 measurement reconciliation:** slot 24 is marked uncertain, and the supplied counts
  total 372 instead of 375. Confirm the missing observations and which game version(s) the
  125-match sample covers before presenting the table as verified across PES 17–21; on
  18–21 it now only shapes the fallback fill, so the stakes are lower than they were.
- **Do 17 slots have role identity** (main vs linesman)? The flat measurements
  don't distinguish roles; if role placement turns out to matter to managers,
  the table needs re-measuring with roles logged. (On 18–21 roles are the list positions.)
