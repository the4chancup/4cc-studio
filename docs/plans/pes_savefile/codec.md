# 4cc Studio — Savefile plan: Save codec

Part of the [Savefile plan](README.md). Section headings are unchanged from the single-file plan, so an existing pointer to a section still names it; only the file part of the pointer changed.

## Schema-driven save codec

4ccEditor's six per-version codec files are near-duplicated sequential bitfield reads:

```cpp
players.lowpass  = read_data(0, 7, current_byte, pDescriptorNew);
players.loftpass = read_data(7, 7, current_byte, pDescriptorNew);
players.finish   = read_data(6, 7, current_byte, pDescriptorNew);
```

In Rust this becomes a declarative schema — one field table per version, one generic codec engine.
Every bit run is LSB-first little-endian: field bit `i` is bit `(offset + i) % 8` of record byte
`(offset + i) / 8`, which is what the reference's byte-crossing reader computes and what the
hand-shifted PES 18 walk computes too.

```rust
/// One bit run of a record.
pub struct FieldSpec<F> {
    pub field: F,
    /// Bit position from the record's first byte.
    pub bit_offset: u32,
    pub bit_width: u32,
}

/// A regular run of indexed fields (`play_skill[0..41]`, roster slots, formation players):
/// element `i` is `make(i)` at `base_bit + i * stride_bits`.
pub struct ArraySpec<F> {
    pub make: fn(u8) -> F,
    pub count: u8,
    pub base_bit: u32,
    pub stride_bits: u32,
    pub bit_width: u32,
}

/// A NUL-terminated byte string field.

}

/// A per-preset setting: one byte at `bit_offset + preset * preset_stride_bits`.

    pub formations: FormationLayout,
    pub instructions: Option<InstructionLayout>,
}

/// Where a section of records sits in the payload.
pub struct SectionLayout {
    pub offset: usize,
    /// Byte offset of the little-endian u16 record count.
    pub count_offset: usize,
}

pub struct VersionSchema {
    pub version: PesVersion,
    pub players: SectionLayout,
    pub player: &'static RecordSchema<PlayerField, PlayerText>,
    /// PES 15/16: the separate appearance array (keyed by player id at +0); `None` when the
    /// appearance fields are inside the player record.

    pub teams: SectionLayout,
    pub team: &'static RecordSchema<TeamField, TeamText>,
    pub rosters: SectionLayout,
    pub roster: &'static RecordSchema<RosterField, TeamText>,
    pub tactics: SectionLayout,

}

pub fn schema_for(version: PesVersion) -> &'static VersionSchema;
```

`F` and `T` are the field vocabularies in `schema/fields.rs` (generated with the tables):
`PlayerField` (scalar variants plus `PlayablePosition(u8)`, `ComStyle(u8)`, `Skill(u8)`),
`PlayerText` (`Name`, `ShirtName`), `TeamField` (identity, colours, edit flags,
`KitSlotNumber(u8)`/`KitSlotTeam(u8)`), `TeamText` (`Name`, `ShortName`), `RosterField` (`TeamId`,
`Player(u8)`, `Number(u8)`), `TacticsField` (`TeamId`, `Preset { preset, field: PresetField }`,
`Formation { preset, formation, slot, part: FormationPart }`, `Instruction { preset, side:
InstructionSide, index, part: InstructionPart }`, `Starting(u8)`, `Bench(u8)`,
`PlayerToJoinAttack(u8)`, the set-piece takers, `Captain`, the auto flags). Variant names are the
readable model names (`TightPossession`, not `tight_pos`); the table module's doc comment says
which reference walk it was derived from, and this section is the evidence trail. The generator
is `scripts/derive_savefile_schema.py <reference source dir> <crate>/src/schema`; it is committed so
the tables can be regenerated, and the tables it wrote are committed as ordinary source.

**Derivation, not transcription.** The tables are not typed in by hand: a lead script interprets
each reference read walk (`fill_player_entry17`, `fill_team_ids21`, …) over a symbolic byte
array, so `read_data(start, bits, …)`, `data[current_byte] >> 4`, `+= (data[current_byte] << 1)
& 127` and the string copies all resolve to which record bits feed which field bits, then checks
every field is one contiguous LSB-first run and emits the Rust tables. The derived tables were
checked against the real payloads (2026-09-14): every player of every save decodes to plausible
values (ages 15–50, abilities 40–99, positions 0–12, valid UTF-8 names), the PES 15/16 appearance
arrays resolve every player id, and the team id at +0 of the team, roster and tactics records
lists the same ids in the same order on every version (which pins all three record sizes).
Record sizes: player 112/112/188/188/188/312/312; appearance 68/72 (15/16); team
456/456/480/480/416/528/588; roster 164 (32 slots) on 15–18, 244 (40 slots) on 19, 284 (40) on
20/21; tactics 516/520/628/628/628/628/628, versions 15 to 21 in order. Counts: players u16 at
0x34/0x34/0x5C/0x60/0x60/0x60/0x60, teams at 0x38/0x38/0x60/0x64/0x64/0x64/0x64.

Reference readings the derivation flagged, kept as the reference has them and listed here so
nobody mistakes them for ours: `b_edit_stadium` on PES 19 is masked to zero by the reference
(`>> 6 & 64`), so the PES 19 table has no such field; the PES 21 team-colour bit positions read
zero for 203 of 220 teams in the 4cc save where PES 17/18 read the same teams' colours, an open
question (worklog) until the reference editor's display of that save is checked.

~190KB of C++ collapses into static tables plus a ~100-line engine (the Rust equivalent of the
reference's `read_data`/`write_data`, which handle bit runs crossing byte boundaries). Roundtrip
tests (read → write → compare bytes, every record of every real payload) verify the tables tile
the bytes they claim; the plausibility census above is what verifies they name them right.

Schema tables needed (following 4ccEditor's actual sharing):

| Schema | Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| 15 | `pes15.cpp` | Own player + separate appearance schema, own bit-read variant |
| 16 | `pes16.cpp` | Split player/appearance blocks |
| 17 | `pes17.cpp` | First unified block; adds `phys_cont` |
| 18 | `pes18.cpp` | New container header; unified block |
| 19 | `pes19.cpp` | Adds `star`; 39 skills |
| 20/21 | `pes20.cpp` (shared, with 21-specific team functions) | Adds `mo_drib`, `tight_pos`, `aggres`, `play_attit`, `strong_hand`; 41 skills |

The same schema mechanism covers the team sections (team IDs, rosters, tactics),
not just player blocks.

### Whole-file API

The consumer-facing entry point wraps the container crypto and the schema codec:
`EditFile::load` (version auto-detected by trying master keys / container shape;
decrypt, parse) and `EditFile::save` (serialize, re-encrypt, and preserve the original in a `.bak`
before replacement — the shared convention behind the save editor's save action and the Team
compiler's savefile update stage). An open `EditFile` keeps its detected version; changing the
suite selector cannot reinterpret it. Compiler updates require a save matching the compile target.
Retain unmodeled container sections, payload bytes, padding, and unknown bits, patching only the
selected known fields; rebuilding only the modeled fields cannot satisfy lossless-save tests.

```rust
/// An open save: the retained container plus the decoded players and teams.
pub struct EditFile { /* container: SaveContainer, players: Vec<PlayerEntry>, teams: Vec<TeamEntry>,
                         plus the record index of every player/appearance/roster/tactics record */ }

impl EditFile {
    /// Decrypts and decodes; the version is the container's.
    pub fn from_bytes(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<EditFile, SaveError>;
    /// `from_bytes` over a file (native only).
    pub fn load(path: &Path) -> Result<EditFile, SaveError>;
    pub fn version(&self) -> PesVersion;
    pub fn players(&self) -> &[PlayerEntry];
    pub fn players_mut(&mut self) -> &mut [PlayerEntry];
    pub fn player(&self, id: u32) -> Option<&PlayerEntry>;
    pub fn player_mut(&mut self, id: u32) -> Option<&mut PlayerEntry>;
    pub fn teams(&self) -> &[TeamEntry];         // team, roster and tactics joined by id
    pub fn teams_mut(&mut self) -> &mut [TeamEntry];
    pub fn team(&self, id: u32) -> Option<&TeamEntry>;
    pub fn team_mut(&mut self, id: u32) -> Option<&mut TeamEntry>;
    /// Every player and team written back into the retained payload, then re-encrypted under
    /// `salt`; the record order and count are the file's own (no player or team is added or
    /// removed through this API).
    pub fn to_bytes(&self, salt: &[u8; 320]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, SaveError>;
    /// `to_bytes` with a fresh salt, written next to `path` and renamed over it after the
    /// existing file was copied to `<path>.bak` (native only).
    pub fn save(&self, path: &Path) -> Result<(), SaveError>;
}
```

`SaveError` wraps `ContainerError`, `CodecError`, `std::io::Error`, plus `Layout` (a section's
count or a record runs past the payload) and `RecordId` (a roster or tactics record names a team
id the team section lacks, or a PES 15/16 player has no appearance record). Loading is strict:
the three team sections must list the same ids in the same order, which every real save does.

**Name colour codes, as measured** (2026-09-14, 346 decorated names across the PES 16/19/21
saves): a code is the byte `0x11`, the letter `c`, then **exactly eight bytes** taken as the
colour; the game does not check they are hex (nine names of one PES 21 team carry
`\x11ca000c8ON` and display without the `ON`), so neither does `display_name`. A second code
exists: `\x11d`, two bytes, which resets the colour (`WHEN THE \x11cb7bec5ffWORK RESULT\x11d WAS
GOOD`). `display_name` strips both; any other `0x11` sequence is left alone. `name` is the raw
form; the save editor renders the colours from it.

### Savefile discovery

The savefile does **not** live in the PES install folder — it is always under the user's
**Documents** folder, in a per-game KONAMI subfolder. Discovery therefore never looks at
`pes_folder_path`; it is a function of the PES version and the user profile, provided by this crate
(`discover_savefiles(version) -> Vec<SavefileCandidate>`) and used by the Team compiler's savefile
stage (`savefile_path = auto`) and the Save editor's Open dialog (initial folder / quick-open list).

Two layouts exist, verified on a live machine with PES 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 21 saves present
(2026-09-14; PES 20 is assumed to match 19 and 21, its neighbours on both sides, until a real
install is seen):

| Versions | Path under `{Documents}\KONAMI\` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 15, 16, 17, 18 | `{game folder}\save\EDIT00000000` | one save per game, no account level. Game folders: `Pro Evolution Soccer 2015` (its save is named `EDIT.bin`, not `EDIT00000000`), `Pro Evolution Soccer 2016`, `Pro Evolution Soccer 2017`, `PRO EVOLUTION SOCCER 2018` (upper case; PES 18 was expected to use the account layout and does not) |
| 19, 20, 21 | `{game folder}\{account id}\save\EDIT00000000` | game folders: `PRO EVOLUTION SOCCER 2019`, `eFootball PES 2021 SEASON UPDATE` (21); 20 unverified. `{account id}` is an 18-digit numeric folder, one per account that has run the game on this profile |

Rules:

- **`{Documents}` is the shell's known folder, never `%USERPROFILE%\Documents`.** Documents is
  frequently relocated (the reference machine has it at `C:\Data\Documents`) or redirected by
  OneDrive; resolve it via `directories::UserDirs::document_dir()` (which wraps
  `SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_Documents)`). On Linux/Wine the same relative layout applies under
  the Wine prefix's Documents; the KONAMI folder name is the anchor either way.
- **Account folders**: with exactly one `{account id}` folder containing a `save\EDIT00000000`, that
  is the result. With several, all are returned as candidates ordered by the savefile's modification
  time, newest first; `auto` mode takes the newest and reports which one it chose
  (`savefile_autodetected`, Info, with the path) so a user with two accounts can pin `savefile_path`
  if the guess is wrong. Folders without a savefile are ignored, not errors.
- **The version is verified after discovery**, not assumed from the folder: the candidate is loaded
  with the ordinary `EditFile::load` auto-detection and must match the requested version, otherwise
  it is reported as a mismatch rather than used (a stale save left by a previous game version in a
  reused folder must not be edited as if it were current).
- **Nothing found** → the consumer's own message (`savefile_missing` in the compiler; an empty
  quick-open list plus the ordinary file picker in the editor). Discovery never creates folders.

The per-version table is data (a `match` on `PesVersion` returning the game folder name and
whether an account folder sits between it and `save`), so a corrected folder name is a one-line
change.

```rust
pub struct SavefileCandidate {
    pub path: PathBuf,
    /// The 18-digit account folder the save sits under (PES 19-21), else `None`.
    pub account: Option<String>,
    pub modified: SystemTime,
}

/// The game folder name and layout for `version`.
pub fn save_layout(version: PesVersion) -> SaveLayout;   // { game_folder: &'static str, account_folders: bool, file_name: &'static str }
/// The candidates under `documents/KONAMI/...` for `version`, newest first. Pure over the
/// given root so tests build a temp tree; the native caller passes `UserDirs::document_dir()`.
pub fn discover_savefiles_in(documents: &Path, version: PesVersion) -> Vec<SavefileCandidate>;
/// `discover_savefiles_in` under the shell's Documents folder (native only).
pub fn discover_savefiles(version: PesVersion) -> Vec<SavefileCandidate>;
```

Discovery returns paths and never opens the saves; verifying the version is the caller's
`EditFile::load` (the plan rule above).
