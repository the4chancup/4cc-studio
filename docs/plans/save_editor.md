# 4cc Studio — Save editor plan

> **Plan:** work not built yet (the open phase's sections may be partly built). What the suite does now is described in `docs/spec/`.

The save editor (`crates/tools/save_editor`) is the successor to **4ccEditor**
and absorbs the **Midcupping** scripts: it edits PES save files (player stats,
appearance, teams, tactics), enforces AATF rules, diffs saves (gameplay and
aesthetics), handles team import/export
(new Team TOML format, legacy `.4ccs`/`.4cct` import, Texport read/write) and
FPC invisibility. It can also **generate `settings.toml` files from an existing
savefile** (via `pes_savefile`'s `PlayerSettings` model), giving teams a migration path
from the manual-editing workflow to the [Team compiler](team_compiler/README.md)'s
compile-time aesthetics (on Fox the CPK's database tables, on pre-Fox savefile writing). The
savefile codec, the data model, and all
interchange formats live in the `pes_savefile` lib crate — see the
[Savefile plan](pes_savefile/README.md). Platform context is in the [core plan](core/README.md).

The porting stance: **full feature parity with 4ccEditor, improved wherever the
Win32 UI imposed friction** — but only with improvements that are actually
useful, never decoration. Concrete improvements are listed per section.

## Background: 4ccEditor

What exists of this is in `spec/save_editor.md` "Background: 4ccEditor".

| Component | Files | Size | Fate in the Rust port |
|-----------|-------|------|----------------------|
| Win32 UI | `main.cpp`, `window.cpp`, `resource.rc`, `menu_lists.cpp` | ~320KB | UI replaced by egui; retain the relevant domain tables in `menu_lists.cpp` as codec/conversion references |

---

## Feature inventory (the parity contract)

What exists of this is in `spec/save_editor.md` "Feature inventory (the parity contract)".

Everything 4ccEditor can do, with its fate in the port. This is the checklist the
implementation is measured against.

### File operations

| 4ccEditor | Fate |
|-----------|------|
| Load 15/16/17/18/19/20/21 EDIT file (7 menu items) | One **Open savefile** action; auto-detect the version by master keys / container shape. The loaded file's version governs its codec and editing widgets; warn on a global-selector mismatch, never reinterpret the open file. The Open menu lists the saves `pes_savefile`'s discovery finds under `Documents\KONAMI` for every version (labelled by version and, for 19+, account folder) as one-click entries, with the files opened earlier in the session, above the ordinary file picker, and the picker opens in the selected version's save folder when it exists — see "Savefile discovery" in the Savefile plan |
| Save EDIT file (encrypted; always asks for a path; the first save after a load keeps the file it replaces as `<file>.BACKUP`) | Kept; plus **Save as**, and the file each save replaces kept as `.bak` (one level), at every save rather than the first after a load only |
| Import Texport file (per-version submenu) | Kept, auto-detected version; plus **Texport export** (new — PES itself can import the result; see [Savefile plan](pes_savefile/README.md)) |

### Player operations

| 4ccEditor | Fate |
|-----------|------|
| Set all ability stats (dialog: every ability stat to N, 40 to 99, prefilled with the player's first; weak foot, form and injury untouched) | Kept, same fields and range; no edit flag set (the dialog writes the ability stats, as typing them does, and typing sets none) |
| Bump all ability stats ±N (dialog, Ctrl+B: N from -10 to 10, remembered; each ability stat clamped to 40 to 99; weak foot, form and injury untouched) | Kept, same, no edit flag set; N is read whole (4ccEditor reads two characters, so -10 bumps by -1) |
| Copy player stats (source PID → dest PID: height, weight, every ability, form, injury, weak foot, registered and playable positions, playing style, skills, COM styles, stronger foot and hand, star, playing attitude, the free-kick motion only, and the edited-player and gameplay edit flags) | Kept, same field set; the other player is picked by team, then by roster slot (two combo boxes: one list of a cup save's 4,600 players cannot be browsed), and copied onto the selected one |
| Swap player stats (two PIDs; the same field set as Copy) | Kept, the other player picked as for Copy |
| Move a player up or down the list (the spinner beside it: one step per click, within one team; the two players' records trade places between their ids, `base_copy_id` traded back to match each slot, shirt numbers and the captain left with the slots) | Kept as drag reorder, with the same effect ("Editing UI", the Player list bullet) |
| Toggle FPC settings (Ctrl+I) | Kept (see "Full Player Customization" below) |
| Quick actions: Make Gold / Make Silver / Make Bronze (from the Autumn 26 edition) / Make Regular / Set stats | Kept, **driven by the AATF rules file** instead of hardcoded rates — the buttons and the checker can never disagree |
| Hidden shortcuts: PgUp/PgDn (previous/next player from any field) | Kept, the list's selection moving |
| Hidden shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+P (a joke preset), Ctrl+Shift+B (a sound), Ctrl+Shift+H (show the dribbling-motion and hand controls), Ctrl+O and Ctrl+5 to Ctrl+1 (open as a given version) | Not kept: Open detects the version and every control is always drawn |
| Hidden shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+T on the team selector (empties the team's slots past 23; its team index looks one off) | Dropped: cups no longer trim a roster to 23 this way |
| Is a copy? (Appearance; ticking it also sets the ability, COM, motion, playable-position, registered-position, skill and playing-style edit flags) | Kept, the same flags set |

### Team operations

What exists of this is in `spec/save_editor.md` "Team operations".

Each operation below acts on the selected row's team, a player's or a team row's own (under
ALL too, as 4ccEditor's do),
on every filled roster slot, as one undoable edit (with no row selected the Team menu is
disabled). 4ccEditor's Set player names to positions
alone renames every row its list shows, which under ALL is every player of the save; that is
not kept, so no team operation reaches past one team.

| 4ccEditor | Fate |
|-----------|------|
| Clear visual settings flags (all players on team) | Kept |
| Set edited/created flag (all players on team) | Kept |
| Set / remove FPC invisibility (whole team) | Kept |
| Set boot/glove IDs for everyone (boots: unchanged, incremental or same for all; gloves: unchanged, like the boots, or same for all; incremental gives slot `k` the start ID + `k` − 1, slots 1 to 23) | Kept, every filled slot of the roster numbered by its slot (4ccEditor stops at the first id missing from the team, a bug not kept), in 4ccEditor's own layout, the maintainer's design: a group per side (`Boot IDs`, `Glove IDs`), its options stacked (`Unchanged`, `Set incremental value:`, `Set all to the same ID:`; `Set like boot IDs`), each option's field in one column across both groups, the incremental range's last ID beside its start, read-only and following it (the start plus 22, slot 23's), drawn as a flat box a shade off the panel with its number in the weak text grey (a disabled widget's faded text is barely readable), the one-ID boxes as wide as the range, each group as wide as its options and fields and the window as wide as the groups; `Set` applies and closes, `Close` closes; a value past the field's range is an error line under the groups |
| Set player names to positions (each name becomes its registered position's full name, "Goalkeeper", and the edited-player flag is set) | Kept, same, and written: 4ccEditor renames the players in memory but never marks the records changed, so its Save writes none of it back (measured, the slice 2 parity run) |
| Load squad (`.4ccs`, with stats/aesthetics/tactics checkboxes) | Kept as read-only legacy import, same section checkboxes; Team TOML import is the primary path. Cross-version import applies the playstyle/skill conversion maps |

### Tactics operations

| 4ccEditor | Fate |
|-----------|------|
| Export / import tactics (`.4cct` "nightly" files) | Import kept (read-only legacy); export replaced by Team TOML (tactics are a section of it) |
| Copy / swap presets (1↔2↔3) | Kept |
| Copy / swap formations (kick-off / in-possession / out-of-possession) | Kept |
| Full tactics editing (see "Tactics editor" below) | Kept at full parity + interaction improvements |
| (none) | New: Save a picture of the formations, bare or with each preset's settings ("Tactics editor", "Formation pictures") |

### Database operations

What exists of this is in `spec/save_editor.md` "Database operations".

| 4ccEditor | Fate |
|-----------|------|
| Output rosters to TSV (`EDIT.tsv` in the working folder, no dialog, UTF-8; every team, hidden ones included, in roster order; per player: number, name, registered position, Finishing as the "rating", captain mark, height, playing style, skills, COM styles) | Kept, the same columns and label spellings, UTF-8 with a byte-order mark (4ccEditor's `ccs=UTF-8` writes one, and a spreadsheet reads accented names right by it); written where a save dialog says, `EDIT.tsv` its default name |
| Fix database (clear all visual flags, reset kit slots, PES17 kit-ID repair; a player's base-copy id cleared when it is neither his own nor 0 and his base-copy flag is off, the flag cleared when the id is his own or 0; every team's strip-edited flag cleared) | Kept as a maintenance action behind a confirmation dialog, under the aesthetics lock (it clears what Clear visual flags clears), one undo step, but for two parts. The base-copy repair runs only where the record has the flag (PES 15 to 18): on 19 to 21 4ccEditor tests a flag it never reads (an uninitialized field), and clearing copy ids there would change players' looks. The PES 17 kit-ID repair is not kept: its 2,500 writes step 131 bytes (`write_dataOld` advances its cursor 3 bytes, then the loop adds 0x80) over a strip table whose entries are 132 bytes (`spec/pes_savefile/model.md` "Kit slots and the strip table"), so all but the first land inside entries' bodies, and each writes 0xC0 into the strip-number byte; a repair of that table waits for its layout to be measured. The kit slots reset where the model has them (PES 17, the one version 4ccEditor writes them on) |
| (none) | New: Save formation pictures for a range of teams ("Tactics editor", "Formation pictures") |

---

## Crate layout

What exists of this is in `spec/save_editor.md` "Crate layout".

Planned files that do not exist yet:

- `src/session/undo.rs` — field-level undo/redo stack over model edits
- `src/session/selection.rs` — team/player selection, cross-team filter query
- `src/session/recent.rs` — discovered saves (`pes_savefile::discovery`) + recent files list
- `src/view/` — the view, in the pre-move tree's shape: `mod.rs` (master-detail layout,
  open/save actions, unsaved-changes prompt), `player_list.rs` (drag-to-reorder, dirty dots,
  colour-coded names), `info_strip.rs` (General info and Other stats), `quick_actions.rs` (the Make
  buttons and Set stats under the list), the player view's other panels (`abilities.rs`:
  the positions, skills, COM styles and ability stats; `appearance/`), the team view
  (`team.rs`, `tactics.rs`), `panels/`
  (`aatf.rs`, `comparator.rs`, `transplant.rs`, `interchange.rs` — Team TOML / `.4ccs` / `.4cct`
  / Texport import-export dialogs) and `widgets.rs` (editor-local reusable widgets: version-gated
  control, ID picker; a color is drawn by how the save stores it: an RGB one (the team colors,
  the only RGB fields a view draws) is `color_tools`' picker, `libs/color_tools.md`, not a
  widget of this crate, the host converting between the picker's 8 bits and the save's 6 per
  channel: a picked channel `c` is stored as `c * 63 / 255` rounded, a stored `v` shown as
  `v * 255 / 63` rounded (the Team compiler's widening of 5:6:5 colors), so a save always
  holds the nearest color it can; 4ccEditor stores `ceil(c / 4.05)` and shows `floor(4.05 v)`,
  so a value can read one higher here (`v` 32: 130, where 4ccEditor shows 129), a difference
  kept on purpose, since the stored value is what reaches the game; a palette
  index (skin, iris, wrist tape, spectacles, gloves, hair accessory, as `settings.toml`'s
  `skin_color` 0-7) is a choice of its palette's entries, never a picker whose free color no
  record can hold)

Placement rules for the planned parts:

- **The views' fields map 1:1 to 4ccEditor's tabs**, which is the parity contract ("Editing
  UI"); a panel is a file of its own, or a function in its group's file, never a section
  grown inside another panel's.
- **`view/panels/` are the Midcupping-derived and new features**; each is self-contained and can be
  developed in the build order below without touching the views.
- **The tactics editor, the card pickers and the violations list are `libs/team_widgets`** (see
  below); the view and panel files here are hosts: they hand the widget the session's team, apply
  the edits it reports to the undo stack, and add what only this tool has (preset copy/swap,
  jump-to-player).

---

## Editing UI

The tool view (the panel right of the suite sidebar) is a master-detail layout after
4ccEditor's own window, without its tabs and its dialog sprawl: a player row selected shows the
player view, every field of the player at once, and a team row the team view, the team's fields
and its tactics. Not tabs: they split one player's fields over pages a member flicked between
to check a build, and every page but the one shown hid what an edit on it depended on (the
skills' card budget counts the positions' extra A ratings); at 1280 points the pane holds them
all side by side.

```

- **Team selector** with an "ALL" entry (as in 4ccEditor), plus a **filter box
  that searches across all teams** (name, shirt name, ID) — finding a player no
  longer requires knowing their team first. Matching uses the colour-code-free
  `display_name()` (see the pes_savefile plan's "Name colour codes"), a team's own name
  included. Picking a team selects its team row, so the detail shows that team's view, its
  tactics with it: a manager who picks a team usually wants its tactics next. Picking ALL keeps
  the selection.
- **Player list**, 255 points wide (its rows' frame and the scroll bar's strip; egui's panel
  margins and separator come on top) and not resizable: under the design width the window scales
  instead of narrowing (`spec/core/gui.md` "Shell layout", the paragraph "Scaling with the width"), so the view always has the
  room the 1280-point layout gives it, and a list dragged wider would only take that room back.
  Its scroll bar stands outside the list's frame, egui's solid bar (4 points from the
  content, 6 wide), so a selected or hovered row's fill reaches the frame's edge and the bar
  covers none of a row's marks (their hover and click), where egui's floating bar lies over
  the content; the strip stays while a filter leaves nothing to scroll, so the list keeps its
  width. The controls above and below it (the team combo, the filter, the quick actions) end
  at the frame's right edge, not at the bar's, so the column reads as one box; Set stats and
  its box still fit at that width.
  A **team row** heads each team's players, set apart from a player row by the
  faint fill under it and its name in the strong text colour (no bold: the app
  installs no bold face, and a second font file for one row costs more than it shows): the team's id, its colours
  1-2 as swatches and its name, then `[click for tactics]` in the weak colour at the normal
  weight (nothing else says where the tactics are; on a narrow row it is elided before the
  name is), a dot when the team's own fields (name, short name, colours,
  ids, kit slots, tactics) have unsaved changes. A click selects the team, and the detail shows
  the team view; it never drags and is no drop target. ALL lists every team's row and players;
  under a filter a team's row stays while its own name or any of its players matches. The team
  row replaces the team bar above the old tabs: the team is one click away from its players,
  where a manager looks for it, rather than a strip that took a row from every player. A
  save opens on ALL with the list's first player row selected.
  A player row shows his place in the roster (`01` to `23`, the slot `NN` of his id, always
  two digits, so no column is kept for right-aligning a one-digit number), position and name,
  with no team name under ALL or a filter: the team row above its players already names it.
  The row's drag handle `≡` stands 4 points from its edge and 4 before the place, as in the
  Tactics view's lineup lists, so the name gets the room the column's narrow width leaves.
  The place, not the shirt number: it is the `NN` of his export's `NN - Name` folder and of
  his id, and General info shows the shirt number; **drag-and-drop reordering**
  replaces the up/down spinner, and moves what the spinner moves: the players' records trade
  places between the ids, each id staying in its roster slot (`base_copy_id` traded so each
  matches its new slot, and the in-game face run's face structure and hairstyle staying too:
  the spinner's record, the `.4ccs` one, holds of that run only the skin, iris and player
  gloves), and the shirt numbers, held by the roster's slots, stay where they
  are, as does the captain mark. The roster's own order is never changed: by 4cc rule slot `NN`
  holds player `team id × 100 + NN` (`plans/aatf_rules.md` "The host"), and reordering the
  roster itself would break it. A drop several rows away is the spinner pressed that many
  times, so the players in between shift one slot along. A drop works on a row of the dragged
  player's own team, in one team's list or under ALL, where each team's rows run unbroken
  under its team row; a drop on another team's row does nothing, and drag is off while a
  filter is typed, where neighbouring rows are not one team's neighbouring slots. A dot marks players with unsaved changes. Names
  render with their savefile colour codes applied as text colours (the in-game
  look; 4ccEditor shows the raw control characters), and the name edit field
  keeps the raw string so codes survive a roundtrip untouched. A code's first six bytes are
  the RGB hex; its alpha is not drawn, and a code whose six are not hex leaves the text the
  normal color (the game does not check them: `spec/pes_savefile/codec.md` "Name colour
  codes, as measured").
- **The quick actions** under the list, in two columns: on the left the medal tiers' Make
  buttons (the tiers whose ids are `gold`, `silver` and `bronze`, in the ruleset's order: Make
  Gold, Make Silver, Make Bronze under the official one), on the right the other tiers' (Make
  Goalkeeper, Make Regular), then Set stats with its number beside it ("Configurable AATF
  rules" below says what they do). Every button and the number's box are 20 points tall
  (their own height, the draft's: the theme's controls are 18), the Set stats row in line
  with the buttons above it. The
  grid spans the list's width; each column is as wide as its widest cell when
  the two fit, else half the list, a longer label then elided (its tooltip names the tier).
  Not halves always, as the draft's `1fr 1fr`: egui's button text is wider than the draft's,
  and a half cuts "Make Goalkeeper" at the default list width. They act on the selected player, so a team row leaves them disabled, their tooltip
  "The make buttons act on a player: pick a player row"; the Player menu's entries are
  disabled too, their tooltip "The Player menu acts on a player: pick a player row".
- **The toolbar**, in egui's `MenuBar` (0.37), its style left as the toolbar's so the
  buttons keep their frames, the bar's pieces (the bar, its separator, a menu item with its
  shortcut) `studio_core`'s widgets rather than this tool's, so every tool's toolbar takes
  them when it is built (this is the first tool with a finished UI): `Open`, `Save`, `Save as`; a separator; `Undo`, `Redo`; a
  separator; the `Player`, `Team` and `Savefile` menus; a separator; the ruleset dropdown and
  Live AATF (with `Show suggestions` while it is on), then `• unsaved changes`, in the link
  blue (`Visuals::hyperlink_color`, the blue of Live AATF's suggestion marks), not the weak
  grey, which hid the one piece saying the save differs from its file among the toolbar's
  quieter text; the blue also tells it is clickable (the changes list). With one menu
  open, the pointer entering another menu's button opens that one instead, as a menu bar
  does (`MenuBar` switches on hover; a plain button such as `Save` opens nothing). Menus
  group by what an entry acts on, not by what it opens: the `Savefile` menu holds the whole
  save's work, the Comparator and Apply aesthetics patch first (each reads another file
  against the save, a second save or a Team compiler's patch), a separator, Output rosters
  to TSV, Save formation pictures for a range of teams and Multi-team AATF, a separator, Fix
  database; the `Team` menu ends with the team's files, Import / export team file (the
  interchange panel) and Save a picture of the formations. There is no Panels menu: that the
  Comparator, the patch and the interchange open as floating panels says nothing a member
  looks for them by. A menu item's shortcut is drawn right of its label in the weak colour
  (`Button::shortcut_text`): Bump all stats `Ctrl+B`, Toggle FPC settings `Ctrl+I`, Clear
  visual flags `Ctrl+F`.
- **No view draws the tool's name** (`core/gui.md` "Window title": the title bar carries it),
  **nor the open save's path**: the tool's `title_detail` gives it to the idle window title,
  in square brackets, and the toolbar keeps `• unsaved changes` alone, which never takes a
  second row.
  Each view's first line titles what it shows, `<id> <name>`: the player view's `70101 QUADS
  ONLY`, the team view's `701 /3/`, the id in the weak colour, as the list draws ids, and the
  name with its colours; its ink as far below the toolbar's buttons as the view's first
  row's ink is below its own (about 11 points each on the maintainer's screen), not close
  under the buttons. The gaps are even in what the eye sees, not in boxes: a line box holds
  more room under the baseline than over the capitals, so equal box gaps of 7 read as 9 above
  and 11 below, and the title sits 2 lower to even them.
- **The player view**: three columns side by side, then the Appearance section, the room
  the fixed columns leave split into four equal gaps: after the player list, between the
  columns, and after Ability stats (29.4 points each at the 1280 × 780 window). The first
  counts from the list's frame, 22 points before the pane (the list's 10-point bar strip and
  the 12 between), and the last runs to the window's edge, past the pane's own 12-point right
  margin: the eye reads the gap from the list's last ink and to the window's edge, and a
  view centred in the pane alone left the gap after the list wider than the gaps between the
  columns (37 against 27). The view's title line and Appearance start at General info's
  title. With General info's 6-point inset below, its labels stand 35 points from the list's
  frame, room for Live AATF's marks left of them (at 36-point gaps centred in the pane they
  were clipped at its edge). At the 1280 × 780 window it fits the pane with no
  scrolling (the draft's check), and the pane is never narrower: a narrower window scales the
  whole UI down (`spec/core/gui.md` "Scaling with the width") and the player list keeps its 255
  points, so the columns sit side by side at every size, each panel in its design's columns,
  with no wrap to keep. Column by column, each panel's title over its content and the
  panels of one column 14 points apart:
  1. **General info**, its column 350 points wide: the title at the column's left edge, the
     fields and their labels 6 in from it, as the ability stats stand in from theirs (their
     cells' padding), so a panel's title heads its body; Other stats the same. The fields 344
     points wide (the draft's: room for the longest pair label,
     "Injury resistance", beside its box on each half, and for the label-left rows, 339
     points in the body font; no wider, so the three columns stay on one row beside the
     255-point list), laid out as 4ccEditor's General Info:
     Name, then Shirt, each a row with its label on the left and its field on the right; then
     label-left pairs on two halves 28 points apart (the first as wide as the label-left
     rows' label column, their 12-point gap and a box, so its boxes start at the x those rows'
     fields start at), Height and Shirt number, Weight and Nation, Age and
     Captain, each box 54 points wide: on the first half at the half's right edge, on the
     second just after a label column as wide as that half's longest label ("Shirt number"),
     so a short label (Nation, Form) keeps its box close; Captain's checkbox centred in its
     box's width, under the Nation box above it. Then Stronger foot and Stronger hand (20+),
     each a two-choice toggle, Left | Right, its chosen side filled in the quiet grey of the
     positions' C (`#5a5a5a`), not the selection's blue: a foot or a hand is rarely what a
     member looks for, and the accent would pull the eye to it; then Registered position, a
     combo whose entries name each position in full after its abbreviation (`AMF - Attacking
     Midfielder`, British spelling: Centre Back; the TSV output and Set player names to
     positions keep 4ccEditor's names, Center Back, as their parity requires), and Playing
     style. Name, Shirt and these
     four rows share one label column, as wide as their longest label ("Registered
     position"), so every one of those fields starts at one x, and each ends flush with the
     second half's boxes, not on the panel's right edge. Under it **Other stats**: Injury resistance and Form, then "Weak foot:
     Usage" and "Accuracy" (the two sharing one label), on General info's halves so every box of
     both panels lines up. Under that **Playable positions**: the 13 positions with C/B/A
     ratings in five rows by line of the pitch, each left wing to right wing (LWF CF SS RWF /
     LMF AMF RMF / CMF DMF / LB CB RB / GK, the midfield in two, GK alone below the others),
     each row centred in the
     panel, each position's label centred over its ratings (over the B), the registered one
     outlined, its corners rounded as the widgets' are (every frame and field in the view is
     rounded; the theme's own radius, not a second one); the chosen rating filled: A a deep green (`#129648`) under a white letter, B the selection's blue, C a grey square, so
     the three tell apart at a glance and an unrated position still shows its C. A click on
     a position's label makes it the registered position, the same undoable edit as General
     info's combo, where the eye already is when choosing among the ratings.
     A field's label in these panels and in Ability stats is drawn in the normal text colour,
     as the checkboxes' labels are, not the weak one: the weak grey read too dark beside them.
     A label and its field are never closer than 9 points on a pair and 12 in the label-left
     rows and Ability stats; the room this takes comes off the margins either side of the centred view.
  2. **Skills**, the Cards left badge in its header, the version's skills (up to 41,
     version-gated) but the active ruleset's tricks or free cards, as checkboxes in two columns
     filled column by column; under it **Tricks**, the skills the ruleset's `tricks` card group
     names, in the game's order, two columns filled the same way: a member weighs a skill
     against the card limit, while the ruleset's free trick allowance usually covers a trick,
     so the two read apart. A ruleset with no `tricks` group (VTL's) shows **Free cards**
     there instead: every skill one of its `free_cards` effects names, those free only for a
     tier, a position or the captain included, so a card does not move between panels when a
     player's tier changes. Neither panel when the ruleset names no such card: every skill then
     stays under Skills. Under them **COM playing styles**, the 7 in two columns
     whose second starts at the skills' second's x. Every cell is one line of one height, a
     version-gated card's disabled one as tall as an enabled one, so each row of the two
     columns shares one y (the draft's disabled cells were 2 points taller, and its second
     column ended 24 points lower).
  3. **Ability stats**, ~25 in one column in the game's order, each label beside its number,
     right-aligned against it, so every label stands 12 points from its box however short
     (left-aligned, a short one such as Jump stood far from its number).
  The three columns' titles share one line: Skills' row is as tall as its Cards left badge, so
  it starts 3 points above the columns' top, and the columns start 3 points lower than a bare
  title would. Every panel title of the view stands 6 points above the first thing drawn under
  it (a field's frame, a checkbox), the badge's lower half overlapping that gap: the spacing of
  the team view's titles, so the two views read alike.
  Then **Appearance**, a collapsing section closed by default, below the columns (its contents
  below). Opening it makes the view taller than the pane, and the pane's scroll bar then
  floats over the view's right margin (egui 0.37's default `ScrollStyle::floating`, which
  takes no room), so nothing shifts when it appears and the view reserves no strip for it:
  the margin the centring leaves is room enough. The pane is one scroll area whatever row is
  picked, so its offset outlives a pick: choosing another player leaves the view where it
  was (clamped where the new view is shorter), and a member editing one part of Appearance
  player after player never scrolls back to it. A scroll area keyed by the player would reset
  it on every pick.
- **The view fills its pane**: the list and the quick actions under it take the pane's whole
  height, and the detail ends at the pane's bottom, with no margin below that would give the
  pane a scroll bar of its own.
- **Name and Shirt.** Each label carries a count in brackets, `Name (28/46)`, that follows the
  field as typed: the name's bytes against the open save's field, the shirt name's letters
  against the 18 every version shows (PES 16's 16), so a longer name a PES 20/21 save holds
  reads `(20/18)`. The count says how near its limit the field is, the limit being the smaller
  of the shown maximum and the portable one below: in the grey of a disabled card's label
  (`#5a5a5a`) under it, in the warning orange on it, in the error red past it. The
  field and its count carry one hover: past the portable limit below, its warning; else
  what counts (on PES 21 "Up to 61 bytes. A plain letter takes one byte, an accented letter two or
  more, and a colour code ten. A colour code is typed as \x11c and eight hex digits.", "Up to 18 letters. Western European accents (é, ü, ñ)
  are fine, but other letters and symbols are not."). The save is where
  a member writes the names a tactical export carries to a cup of any version, so its Name and
  Shirt fields follow `pes_savefile`'s portable limits (`spec/pes_savefile/operations.md` "Team TOML"):
  - **Name**: the open save's own field (61 bytes on PES 20/21, 46 before), so `(10/61)` on a PES
    21 save (a colour code counts ten, an accented letter two or more). A name past 46
    bytes, which only a PES 20/21 save holds, draws its field with an amber tint, its count red,
    and the hover "In PES 2019 and older the game cuts this name to «…»", the name as
    `crop_player_text` would cut it. A tint of the theme's warning colour, not a pale yellow
    fill: the theme is dark and its text light, which a pale fill would wash out.
  - **Shirt**: 18 letters on every version but PES 16 (its field holds 16), so `(11/18)`. A
    shirt name the save already holds past 18 (PES 20/21 allow more) is kept, drawn with the
    same tint and the hover "PES 2019 and older show 18 letters of a shirt name (PES 2016 shows
    16)"; an edit may shorten it but not lengthen it, so it can be fixed a keystroke at a time.
  - Nothing more: a warning, never a block on Save, so editing a save stays frictionless.
  - What 4ccEditor's fields do besides storing, kept: a name or shirt name edit sets the
    player's edited-player flag; a shirt name is upper-cased as typed; Captain is a radio
    that makes this player's slot the team's captain and is not unticked by a second click
    (the captain belongs to the slot). 4ccEditor's "Edited/created player" checkbox is not
    kept: the name and shirt name edits set the flag, and the Team menu's Set edited flag
    covers a team, which is what a member sets it for.
- **Contents 1:1 with 4ccEditor's tabs**, which are the parity contract, but for stronger hand,
  which 4ccEditor draws on its Appearance tab and the player view in General info, beside the
  gameplay values it is; star and playing attitude stay with Appearance, in its Cutscenes
  group:
  - **The numbers** are the game's, in 4ccEditor's ranges: abilities 40 to 99, form 1 to 8,
    injury resistance 1 to 3, weak foot usage and accuracy 1 to 4 (these four stored one
    lower), and the Cutscenes group's star 0 to 7 and playing attitude 0 to 3, each inside the
    field's bit width on every version. A value the save holds outside its range shows as
    stored and changes only when the member edits it: drawing a player never edits him (an egui
    number control clamps the value it draws unless told not to, which would mark him unsaved on
    sight).
  - **The skills' Cards left badge** is the active ruleset's, the toolbar's ruleset dropdown's
    ("Configurable AATF rules"), and reads the player's own tier
    alone (`Cards left for Gold: 6 of 8`, no `cards` after the count, which the label
    before it already says; `Cards left: No tier matches` when none
    does, the reason after the colon): the tier his stats,
    registered position and height match under that ruleset, as `check-aatf` recognizes it,
    not one badge per tier, which a member had to match to the player by eye. A tier check that fails on
    the player shows `Tier check failed, click for more information.` in the error colour in
    the badge's place, its click opening a dialog titled `The tier check failed` with the
    error (the AATF check never runs the two functions the badge asks, so a member's edit that
    breaks only them would otherwise show nowhere).
  - **Appearance** — first a **Cutscenes** group, star (19+) and playing attitude (20+),
    outside the aesthetics lock: they change only cutscenes, so they are no aesthetic the
    export owns. Then the ownership line, the switch and the locked groups, each group's
    labels in their own aligned cells, the draft's pairs per row (physique two, the strip's
    ids, enums and checkboxes four, motion two): edit flags (face,
    hair, physique, strip, motion, base copy + copy-from ID), physique sliders (14 values),
    strip style (boots ID, gloves ID — any player's, 0 = normal hands — taping, spectacles,
    sleeves, inners, socks, undershorts, shirttail, the player-gloves checkbox with its
    gloves colour, the wrist tape L/R and spectacles colours), motion (hunching, arm
    movement, kick motions, gc1/gc2, randomize; dribbling motion 20+), colours (skin,
    iris), then the Full Player Customization group.
    Editable, as in 4ccEditor, unless the "Aesthetics from exports" setting is on — see
    "Read-only aesthetics" below.
    The motion fields' ranges are the version's measured ones (`pes_savefile`'s `motion_top`:
    a 1-based motion runs from 1 to its top plus one, a goal celebration from 0, OFF, to its
    top). **Randomize** sets every motion but the dribbling motion to a value drawn from 1 to
    its shown top, as one undoable edit. 4ccEditor's button (`main.cpp`, `IDB_MOTI_RAND`)
    also draws from 1 and leaves the dribbling motion alone, but caps by two fixed sets
    (PES 15 to 19: hunching 3, arm movement 8, corner kick 6, free kick 16, penalty 4,
    celebrations 122; PES 20+: 5, 10, 10, 20, 7, 162), which give a PES 15 player arm
    movements and celebrations that game does not have (its tops are 5 and 112) and never
    reach PES 18's and 19's last celebrations (127, 140); the measured tops do neither.
- **The team view**: `<id> <name>` as its title (above), in the body text's strong weight
  rather than a heading's size; then one row holding the team's name (`Name`, a 140-point
  box: the title already says it is the team's, as `Short` names its short name), short name
  and colours 1-2 (RGB, each colour's picker and its hex, labelled `Col. 1` and `Col. 2`), the
  short name's box taking three characters (the game shows a three-letter abbreviation; every
  version stores it in 4 bytes, so a longer one typed would not reach the game as typed),
  manager ID and stadium ID (19+) and a **Kit slots…** button opening the kit slot
  assignments in a dialog (rarely edited, so not a panel that pushes the tactics down; a
  version that stores none says so in it). The ids share the fields' row, not one of their
  own, because the Tactics editor below needs the height: with a heading-size title and the
  ids on a second row its last row ended about 5 points past the 1280 x 800 window's pane.
  Then the Tactics editor (below), whose bench list shows the
  players only (12 for a 4cc team), not the 21 bench-order entries with 9 `(empty)`.
- Version-gated widgets render disabled with a tooltip ("PES 19+") rather than
  disappearing, so the UI stays spatially stable across versions.
- **Undo/redo** across all edits — the single biggest safety upgrade over
  4ccEditor. An undo entry holds the before and after of each model entry it changed (a
  `PlayerEntry`, a `TeamEntry`): the model is plain data, an entry is a few hundred bytes, and
  one mechanism serves every widget, since a widget edits a copy and reports only that it
  changed (`libs/team_widgets`' contract), not which field. One entry per gesture: changes
  from one widget merge into the open entry while a pointer button is held or a widget has
  keyboard focus, so a drag or a typed value is one undo step, not one per frame. A gesture
  ends when its widget loses the keyboard (a click on another control, a Tab), so a typed
  value and the click that follows are two steps even when one widget call reports both.
- **Unsaved changes** are the difference from the file as opened or last saved, not the undo
  stack's length: undoing back to the saved state clears the dot. A player's dot covers his
  entry and his roster slot's shirt number.
- Keyboard shortcuts preserved where they earn their keep (Ctrl+S save, Ctrl+F
  clear visual flags, Ctrl+I FPC toggle). Ctrl+I acts on a player, so it does nothing on a
  team row, as the Player menu's entries are disabled there; Ctrl+F is a team operation and
  acts on the selected row's team.
- Closing, or opening another save, with unsaved changes prompts: save, discard or cancel,
  over a table of what would be saved or lost, columns Item, Old value and New value (the
  table spans the prompt's width, the two value columns sharing its right part; the prompt
  is as wide as its widest row, up to nine tenths of the window, each row on one line, so a
  renamed player's long name reads in full without a sideways scroll; only a row wider than
  that scrolls), one row
  per changed field against the file as opened or last saved (the dots' baseline, so an edit
  undone back is not listed), the players' rows first, then the teams' own fields. A row is
  worded as the Comparator panel's are, in the views' terms: the item is the player's display
  name (or the team's name) and the field's label as the view draws it, the values as the
  view shows them.
  The table is computed when the prompt opens, not per frame; players through
  `pes_savefile`'s `compare_players`, teams through a team twin of it over the team, roster
  and tactics schemas.
- The toolbar's `• unsaved changes` is a clickable label (Sense::click, the pointing-hand
  cursor, tooltip "Lists the changes since the save was opened or last saved"): a click opens
  a popup under it holding the close prompt's table (the same rows, computed when the popup
  opens, the table scrolling past 240 points) and none of the prompt's answers. The popup
  closes on a click outside it, Esc, a second click on the label, or any edit, undo or redo
  (its rows would otherwise go stale under it); the toolbar's Undo is a click outside, so the
  label reopens the list one row shorter. A popup, not a window: the list is a glance at what
  Save would write, read and dismissed, where the panels hold results a member works against.
  Its left edge is the label's, slid left when it would pass the window's edge. In the table,
  the prompt's and the popup's alike, a colour's old and new values each draw a 12-point
  swatch before the hex, so the rows carry the colour typed rather than as text.
- Save with the save's own PES running asks first ("Writing a save while its game runs",
  below); another version's game asks nothing.
- A save of another version than the sidebar's selector opens with a Warning notice in the
  status bar naming both (SE-GUI-28); the save keeps its own version. The warning lives from
  the save's opening until the member has seen it: its action, **Switch to PES 20xx** (the
  save's version), which makes the same change the sidebar's selector makes, its blockers
  included (a switch a blocker refuses, such as a running compile, leaves the warning up, as
  the selector stays mismatched); its dismiss; or another notice taking the bar from it while
  it is shown (a notice arriving while the versions match, such as a save's, ends nothing:
  no warning was there to see). While it lives it follows the selector: shown whenever the
  selector names another version than the save's, its text naming the selector's (a save opened under its own version too, once the selector moves
  away), gone while the two match, back when they part again. Once it has ended, nothing
  shows until another save is opened. A notice, not a banner under the
  toolbar: the status bar is where the shell's environment warnings already sit, and a banner
  pushed every view down a row. Not a switch on open: the selector also sets what the other
  tools target (the Team compiler's game), and a member opening an old save to look at it must
  not retarget them.

Improvements policy: each of the above exists to remove a real friction point
(finding players, reordering, fear of misclicks). No animations-for-the-sake-of-it.

## Writing a save while its game runs

This changes what `spec/save_editor.md` "CLI" says under "Writing a save" (the refusal, and
SE-CLI-02, which SE-CLI-03 replaces once built).

A save can be written while its own version's PES runs, as long as the game's Edit mode is
closed: PES writes the save it holds over the file when the member leaves Edit mode, so a
write made while Edit mode is open is lost then, while a write made with it closed stands, and
Edit mode's **Load** option reads it in without restarting the game.
So the tool asks the member to make sure Edit mode is closed rather than refusing. We do not
refuse, as the first rule did on the belief that the game writes its save back when it exits:
that made a member close the whole game for every edit, which Load makes unnecessary. A PES of
another version asks nothing, since a game only writes its own version's save.

- **The window.** Save, Save as and the unsaved-changes prompt's Save, with the save's own PES
  running, first show a dialog naming the game: it asks the member to make sure the game's
  Edit mode is closed, closing it if it is open, and says that Edit mode's Load reads the saved
  file in. Its buttons are Save, which writes, and Cancel, which writes nothing (and, under the
  unsaved-changes prompt, keeps that prompt open).
- **The command line**, which cannot ask: a writing command (`import-toml`, `apply-patch`,
  `strip-and-seed`, `check-stripped --strip-again`) with the save's own PES running writes
  only when given `--edit-mode-closed`, the member's answer to the window's question. Without
  it, the command writes nothing and exits 2, its message naming the game and the flag. Not a
  warning followed by the write: a write made while Edit mode is open is lost without a word,
  and the warning would come after it.
- The Team compiler's savefile step follows the same rule (`spec/team_compiler/pipeline.md`
  "Savefile update").
- Scenarios: SE-GUI-21 and SE-CLI-03 (the Acceptance section).

## Tactics editor

Full parity with 4ccEditor's Tactics tab, drawn in the team view under the team's fields:
preset selector (1/2/3) with fluid
checkbox, the three sliders (support range, defensive line, compactness) and the two
numbers in attack and defence (stored 1 to 3, `spec/pes_savefile/operations.md`, each a
three-choice toggle, Few | Medium | Many, rather than a three-step slider whose number a
member had to hover to read), formation settings toggles (attacking style, zone,
buildup, positioning, defensive style, containment, pressure), advanced
instructions (2 attack + 2 defense, with target player where applicable),
set-piece takers (FK long/short/2, CK L/R, PK), captain, auto flags (substitution,
offside trap, atk/def levels, preset change), the three formations per preset,
starting eleven and bench order.

The interaction layer is rebuilt around direct manipulation (this is where the
Win32 original hurt the most):

- **The pitch is the editor**: an egui painter canvas draws the formation;
  players are **dragged** to reposition (x/y), with position labels and snapping.
  4ccEditor's per-slot dropdown + coordinate fields remain as a detail popover on
  click, not the primary interface: its header the starter's name and `player <n>` (his
  roster slot counted from 1), under it the position dropdown, with no label (its abbreviations say what
  it holds), and Make GK beside it at its own width, the two filling the popover's width, its top-right corner on the marker's bottom-left corner as it
  stood at the click, and there it stays while his X and Y change, so the fields' arrows stay
  under the pointer rather than moving off with the marker; a press outside it closes it, as
  Close does. The position dropdown lists only the positions his spot offers, as the game's
  Select Position menu does: the two of the drop rule below ("A pitch player dropped on
  another"), his own first when the spot offers neither (an odd save's); a change of his X or
  Y applies the same rule, as one step of a drag does, so a Y typed into another band changes
  his position with it. The editor is **one grid** of three columns (the
  settings, 422 points; the pitch, 320; the assignments, the rest) and three rows, so every
  panel lines up with its neighbours rather than wrapping on its own:
  1. The **preset bar** (Preset 1/2/3, Fluid formation, then its Copy/swap menu) level with
     the **formation bar** (Kick-off / In-possession / Out-of-possession and theirs), which
     spans the pitch's column and the next: the formations and their menu need more than the
     pitch's width. While the shown preset's Fluid formation is off (PES 2015 has no switch,
     so always), the formation selector is disabled and on Kick-off, its hover
     `Formations 2 and 3 are used only while Fluid formation is on`: the game fields the
     other two only while it is on, so editing them there edits nothing a match uses, and
     switching Fluid formation off moves the view back to Kick-off. It locks even when the
     other two differ from Kick-off: the view is the manager's and copies the game's, and an
     organizer looking for formations hidden there finds them in the formation pictures
     ("Formation pictures" below), a quicker check across teams than the view. Their Copy/swap menu
     stays, a copy into them being how a member prepares them before switching it on.
  2. **Formation settings**, the pitch and **Player assignments**, the two panels exactly as
     tall as the pitch (386 points with its border) and level with it. Formation settings
     runs row by row, each offensive setting beside its defensive pair (Attacking style beside
     Defensive style, Buildup beside Containment area, Attacking zone beside Pressure,
     Positioning beside Defensive line, Support range beside Compactness, Numbers in attack
     beside Numbers in defence: the original's arrangement), every row the same height, the
     panel's free height shared among them; each label over its control, every control in a
     box 24 points tall, so a toggle's centre is level with a slider's and every label stands
     the same distance above its control. The settings column is as narrow as the widest
     toggle choice allows ("Frontline Press.", two such choices a half). Player assignments
     lists the set-piece takers, the captain and **Join the attack** as three rows, one per
     joining player, all three one picker (below); each label stands 4 points under the
     button above it, which leaves 3 of the panel's height free at its bottom. Player
     assignments and Advanced instructions start 6 points under their titles, as Formation
     settings does.
  3. **Advanced instructions** over **Automatic settings** in the settings column, beside the
     **starting eleven and bench** lists, which span the other two columns, each list half of
     them (twelve 18-point rows, padded 4 points top and bottom: the eleven with a row to spare,
     which the bench uses for its twelfth player), the two sides' bottoms level. A row's
     position (the formation's for a starter, the registered one on the bench) is drawn in
     its group's colour, the pitch badge's (below, "A marker"), so a list reads as the pitch
     does at a glance; the names stay the text colour. Advanced
     instructions is one grid: the headers Attack and Defence over their columns, each
     instruction's number (1, 2) beside its two combos, each target under its combo.
     Automatic settings is one grid of two columns of 24-point rows (Substitution beside
     Preset change, Offside trap beside Attack/defence levels), its panel grown to the lists'
     bottom. Substitution is a combo naming the game's choices (measured in game: Off 0, Very
     late 1, Flexible 2 on PES 15, 16 and 21, Very early 3 on PES 21; PES 17's screen lists
     Off, Very late, Flexible and Very early, PES 21's four in PES 21's order, so its stored
     values are read as PES 21's and it offers the four; PES 18 to 20, between the two, offer
     the four too, taken rather than looked at, a look at each game's Substitution choices
     still to come), a stored value outside them shown as its number, so the combo never
     misreports the save.
  The grid is laid out at the design width; a narrower window scales the whole UI with its
  width (`spec/core/gui.md` "Scaling with the width") rather than rearranging it, so the grid has
  no narrow fallback. A shorter window scrolls the team view to reach its last row rather
  than squeezing it in.
- **The pitch looks like PES 2021's own formation screen** (Edit, Teams, a team, Game Plan,
  Team Sheet/Edit Position), each starter shown as the game shows him, by his portrait, read
  from the selected game's `download/` CPKs when that folder is found and holds one. Every
  version's save draws the same pitch: it is the editor's look, not a version gate. The
  reference is the screen's own pitch texture (the 480 x 576 pitch with faint lines in the
  atlas of `common/menu/general/gamePlan.bin`, `Data/dt11_x64.cpk`; the 4cc patch does not
  replace it) and a 1280 x 720 capture of the screen, which draws that texture at two thirds
  of its size (mean luma difference 1.7 of 255). The canvas is drawn at the capture's scale,
  320 x 384, and painted from these measurements rather than from the texture, which is
  Konami's and which a member without PES 2021 does not have:
  - **Turf**: eleven equal horizontal bands, dark at both ends, dark `#2d571d` and light
    `#35602a`, with the texture's grain (a fixed noise of luma deviation about 3.5).
  - **Lines**: white at 20% opacity, 2 px wide; no touchlines (the texture has none). The
    halfway line; the centre circle, radius 36; each penalty box 160 wide, centred, 66 deep;
    each goal area 74 wide, 22 deep; each penalty arc, of the centre circle's radius about the
    penalty spot 44 from the goal line, drawn outside the box.
  - **A slot's spot** is its marker's badge centre, at (12.8 + 2.827 x, 363.8 - 6.793 y) on
    the canvas: x 0 to 104 across the width, y 24 on the halfway line, the attack end up. This
    is the screen's own mapping, fitted on the ten outfield slots of /3/ (the 4chan Cup save)
    within half a pixel. A drop snaps through the same mapping. The keeper's marker is drawn
    where the screen draws him, badge centred on the goal area's line (canvas y 358.5), not
    through the mapping, which would put his stored spot 15 px higher; that spot is (52, 3)
    in every one of the PES 2021 save's 1,890 formations, and the editor never moves it.
  - **A marker**, top to bottom: the portrait, the whole 128 x 128 texture drawn 50 x 50
    standing on the badge (the cup's portraits carry their own padding and any ribbon); the
    badge, 50 x 14 under the 50-point portrait, `#242b2d`, corners 2, the position's
    abbreviation at its left in its group's colour (forwards `#ff2c77`, midfielders
    `#57e42b`, defenders `#00d2ff`, keeper `#ffde00`) and his overall at its right in white,
    both at 11.5 pt and 2 in from their ends as the game's ink is (measured on a 720p
    capture), a medal's outline round it (both below, "A starter's badge"). At 11.5 the
    widest pair, a three-letter position and an overall of 100 or more (`CMF 109`), measures
    44 and leaves about 2 between them; where the two come close their colours tell them
    apart. The badge is not widened for it: a wider badge stood off the portrait's edges. The
    name in its colour codes' colours (white where it has none: the screen
    draws them as its lists do), 13 px below the badge's centre, centred, or from the
    badge's left edge and cut to the badge's width when wider. A wider name scrolls as the
    game's does (measured on four names over 30 s captures): every 13.5 s it scrolls left at
    40 px/s through one loop, its width plus a 16 px gap after which its start follows,
    so it ends where it began, and holds still the rest of the period; a name that fits never
    moves. A **Scroll names** checkbox right of the formations' Copy/swap, on by default and
    remembered in the tool's settings as Live AATF is, holds every wider name still at its
    badge's left when off (a view setting, not an edit: no undo entry, no unsaved dot). Each
    name's period starts when the pitch first shows it, still first. The game
    staggers names by a rule not established (two names 2.1 s apart); the editor's start
    together when the team view opens. The captain's mark, a white rounded box with a black "C", 12 x 11,
    outlined 1 px in the badge's colour (`#242b2d`, as the game's: on a light portrait the
    white box would otherwise have no edge), sits 5 px above the badge over the portrait, its
    outline 1 px inside the badge's left edge (measured on a 720p capture). A starter whose
    portrait the editor cannot show, for any reason (none in the CPKs, one that does not
    decode, a folder, list or CPK that cannot be read, no PES folder set, or one still being
    read, which would otherwise draw nothing and then the portrait), shows the game's
    own placeholder in its place, drawn as a portrait: the selected game's
    `common/render/symbol/blank/player-dummy.png`, a 128 x 128 PNG in one of three versions
    (PES 2015; PES 2016-2018; PES 2019-2021). The three are bundled
    (`resources/portraits/`), not read from the install, so the pitch draws them with no PES
    folder set or reachable. Markers are drawn from the top of the
    canvas down, a lower marker covering the one above as the game's do (the keeper's
    portrait over a centre-back's badge), the dragged one last; a press or a drop hits the
    marker drawn on top.
  - **Portraits** come from the selected game (the sidebar's PES and the "PES folder"
    setting): the CPKs its `download/DpFileList.bin` lists, a later CPK's portrait winning
    as in game, at the path the Team compiler writes portraits to (`player_<id>.dds` up to
    PES 2018, `<id>.dds` from PES 2019; a WESYS-wrapped DDS unwrapped). The list and the
    CPKs' tables are read, and the shown team's portraits decoded, off the UI thread; a
    folder, list or CPK that cannot be read leaves every marker with the placeholder, the
    reason logged. A listed CPK that is missing counts as one that cannot be read: the game then
    loads none of `download/`'s CPKs (the Team compiler's `dpfilelist_cpk_missing`), so
    portraits from the others would show what the game does not. The DpFileList reader is `cpk`'s and the portrait path `pes_savefile`'s, shared
    with the Team compiler, so the editor finds a portrait wherever the compiler put it.
  - **The screen's selection marks** are reused for the editor's states: the open popover's marker gets the selected
    player's corner brackets (`#14fbff`), and every marker the armed assignment mode can take
    gets the candidates' (`#ff4e7f`), each a 50 x 50 box of corners around the portrait; a
    join member while join mode is armed has its badge filled `#005c80`.
  - **The formation's name** sits in the pitch's bottom-left corner as the screen writes it
    (`3-3-1-3`): the ten outfield slots counted by the row of the playable positions grid
    their position belongs to, back to front, an empty row left out: LB CB RB, then DMF CMF,
    then LMF AMF RMF, then LWF CF SS RWF. The keeper never counts and the spot plays no part.
    Read off PES 2021's screen on four teams' eight formations (an AMF given CMF at his own
    spot turns `3-3-1-3` into `3-4-3`; DMF DMF CMF LMF RMF SS CF reads `3-3-2-2`, the wide
    midfielders with the AMF, not the CMF). The grid's rows and the name are one table, so the
    two cannot disagree. It names the shown formation of the shown preset: a slot's position
    change updates it, a drop's included (the pitch-drop bullet below). The label is white, its digits 15 pt tall at the pitch's scale, its ink
    7 pt in from the pitch's left edge and its bottom 6 pt up from the bottom edge (measured
    on the 720p capture), drawn after the markers so a low marker never covers it. The
    typeface need not be the game's, but the stroke must match the game's label, about 3 px
    on its 15 px digits: the body font's semibold (`resources/fonts/RobotoFlex-Semibold.ttf`,
    Roboto Flex cut at weight 600 and the regular's optical size, SIL OFL 1.1 as the
    regular), a font family of its own (the semibold, then the body chain's fallbacks), at
    20.5 pt (digits 15.2 pt tall), the text placed 6.5 pt in for the face's 0.6 pt left
    bearing. We use Semibold, not Bold, because egui's dark-mode text alpha (`2c - c²`)
    thickens strokes: drawn so, Selawik Semibold's verticals measured 2.97 px against the
    game's 3.01 and Bold's 3.41; Roboto Flex's semibold stem is 3% wider than Selawik's, so
    about 3.05 drawn (inferred from the outlines, not measured on a render). It is the one text
    in the suite not in the regular weight. The
    formation pictures (worklog 8.33) carry it in every cell when they come.
- **Lineup by drag-and-drop**: the starting XI and bench are reorderable lists;
  **dragging a bench player onto a pitch player swaps them** (and vice versa).
  The arrow-button ordering UI is gone.
- **Click-to-assign roles**: "players to join attack" (and other
  pick-N-players settings) are set by clicking players on the pitch in an
  assignment mode — the three dropdowns are gone. Join the attack shows its three players as
  three rows (`Unassigned` where fewer join), and any row arms the one join mode, all three
  highlighted, in which pitch clicks add and remove up to three. Set-piece takers get the
  same treatment with a role palette, and so does an advanced instruction's target: its chip
  under the instruction arms a mode in which one pitch click writes the clicked starter and
  disarms, the chip enabled only while the instruction takes one of ours. No note explains the armed mode: the highlighted chip
  and the candidates' corner brackets on the pitch say it.
- Copy/swap preset and copy/swap formation are two small menus, on the preset bar and the
  formation bar, each acting on the selected preset or formation: a copy to, then a swap
  with, each of the other two ("Copy to 2", "Copy to 3", "Swap with 2", "Swap with 3" from
  preset 1; "Copy to In-possession" and so on for a formation), four entries rather than the
  nine pairs of 4ccEditor's menu tree (its 18-item menu is not kept).
- **A starter's badge shows his overall and his medal tier**, as the game's shows the
  overall. The overall is his per-position overall at his slot's position (the formula the
  pitch drop's rule uses, below), so a position change on the popover or a swap redraws it;
  it is exact on PES 2017 and within 2 of the game's on PES 2021 (108 of 201 read there
  equal), the precision the drop's paragraph states. A player the active ruleset
  recognizes as a medal tier (the tier ids `gold`, `silver`, `bronze` every ruleset shares)
  gets a 1.5-point outline inside the badge's edge in the tier's colour: gold `#cc9900` (the
  tier's name colour), silver `#c0c0c0`, bronze `#8c4a20` (far darker than the metal's
  `#cd7f32`, which a thin outline let pass for gold: on an outline this thin the tiers' colours
  must differ plainly); any other tier, a ruleset that does
  not load, or none, gets no outline. An outline, not the badge filled in the metal: on the
  three metals the position colours read at a contrast of 1.0 to 2.4 and white at 1.8 to 3.1.
  Join mode's fill (`#005c80`) replaces the dark one under the outline while armed.
- **Formation pictures.** The Team menu's "Save a picture of the formations…" writes one PNG
  of the selected row's team through a dialog of the tool's own, not rfd's save-file dialog,
  since a native dialog cannot hold the checkbox the range dialog has too: the folder last used
  (the tool's `formation_pictures_folder` setting, which the range dialog shares) with Browse
  for rfd's folder picker, the file name `<id> <name>.png` filled in (the name less the
  characters a file name cannot hold, `718 f.png`; the id first so a folder sorts as the teams
  list does), and the checkbox "With each preset's settings beside its row", which adds or
  removes " settings" before the extension, so a team's two pictures do not replace each
  other. Labels and fields sit on one grid, every field starting at one x. A name already in
  the folder asks "Replace it?" first; the picture is then written and a success notice names
  it, with an Open folder action. The picture: the theme's panel colour under the team's name
  in its colour codes' colours, its id and the save's version (a folder of pictures from
  several saves would otherwise not say which game each came from); one row per preset,
  labelled "Preset n", with "Fluid On" or "Fluid Off" under it in the text colour (PES
  2016 on), with or without the settings; each cell the pitch as the view paints it at its own 320 x 384, the
  formation's name in its corner, with none of the view's states (no drag, corners or join
  fill, a wider name held still at the badge's left). The columns are the three formations
  under their names; a preset with fluid formation off draws its Kick-off formation alone, the
  room beside it empty, unless its other two are not exact copies of Kick-off: then it draws
  all three, as a fluid preset does, since a team can hide formations there and switch Fluid
  formation on in a match, and the picture is the organizers' check (PES 2015, with no switch,
  draws Kick-off alone); the other two are drawn at 60% opacity over the background, so they
  read as unused, perhaps left there forgotten by the manager, rather than as a fluid set. A team whose every row draws one formation gets one column and no
  column heads (a lone "Kick-off" would name a switch the team never makes). With the
  settings, a 240 point column at the grid's right lists each preset's settings level with its
  row, in the Tactics editor's order: the Formation settings' offensive then defensive half,
  the Advanced instructions (PES 2017 on), each target on a line of its own under its
  instruction, at the value's x after `↳` (the symbols font's), where on the instruction's
  line after an arrow a name had only the room the instruction left; a label in the text
  colour and its value strong at 120 points, values named as the editor's controls name
  them, full length. The column holds the widest fixed value (Attacking Full-Backs) with a
  few points to spare, and a target's name longer than that is cut with an ellipsis, rather
  than every picture widened for the few long names (up to 282 points among the sample
  saves' players) and left with empty room on the right. The team's Automatic settings,
  which no preset owns, are one line under the grid. The pitch painter is one
  function the view and the picture share, taking the formation it paints. The Savefile menu's
  "Save formation pictures for a range of teams…" writes one such picture per team whose id
  lies between two teams picked in combo boxes on one row, `Teams`, the first, `to`, the last,
  as Multi-team AATF picks its range (the save's teams by name as the player list's selector
  lists them, the save's first and last by default; not typed ids, which a member would have to
  look up): a count line under them ("4 teams"; "The first team comes
  after the last" in the warning colour, Save pictures off), the folder row with Browse, the
  same checkbox, and the file-name line, which follows it. The dialog is as wide as its longer
  state, the file-name line sized for both of the checkbox's, so it keeps its width when the
  checkbox flips, and its labels and fields sit on one grid. An existing file is replaced, the
  file-name line saying so. The dialog then turns into the run's progress ("Writing 2 of 4: /f/
  (718)", a ProgressBar, Stop, which keeps the pictures written so far) and then its result
  ("4 pictures written to …", or "Stopped after 2 of 4 pictures; they are in …", Open folder
  and Close): the run is the tool's own, so it reports in its view, not the status bar. The
  teams' portraits are read before each picture, as the view reads them, so a cell never shows
  the placeholder where the view shows a face. Drawing the picture: egui's Painter draws to the
  screen only, so the pitch painter draws through a small target that both the view's
  `Painter` and an `image::RgbaImage` implement, text through `ab_glyph` (already in the tree
  through epaint) from the view's fonts, the symbols font after the body font for `↳`, rather than a software renderer (a new dependency) or screenshot crops
  (the view would flicker through every formation).
- Formation edits participate in undo/redo like everything else.

What the controls write, where the draft and 4ccEditor's tab (`tab_four_dlg_proc`) could differ:

- **An advanced instruction's list** is the version's stored table in its stored order (the
  game's own list), split by side as the game's Game Plan splits it: an Attack combo lists the
  attacking instructions, a Defence combo the defending ones (Swarm the Box, Deep Defensive
  Line, Gegenpress, Tight Marking, Counter Target, and Wing-Back from PES 2018; the Rigged
  Wiki's Tactical pages for PES 2017, 2019 and 2021, Konami's PES 2019 manual counting 9 and
  6; every version's stored table lists the attacking ones first). One list for both would
  offer a slot what the game cannot put there. The side is `pes_savefile`'s (`Instruction`,
  beside `takes_player`), the one place the rule lives. Each list is less Tight Marking: it marks an opponent, which a member sets in a match,
  and Edit mode does not offer it (4ccEditor's lists leave it out for that reason). A record
  that holds it, or an instruction of the other side, shows it as the current choice. The target-player pick is enabled only for the
  instructions that take one of ours, Counter Target, Defensive and Anchoring (`pes_savefile`'s
  `Instruction::takes_player`, the one place the rule lives); picking an instruction that takes
  none sets the target to none (255), so no stale target is kept where 4ccEditor left one.
  Under an instruction that takes none of ours the disabled target shows no player of ours:
  "An opponent" under a held Tight Marking (its byte is the opposing formation's slot),
  "No target" under the rest (the game reads no target there).
- **Players to join the attack stay packed**: removing one moves the later ones up, as
  4ccEditor's three combos keep them (an empty first entry clears the rest), so the record
  never holds a gap.
- **The goalkeeper's slot is fixed**: its marker is not dragged and its position, X and Y are
  not edited, as 4ccEditor locks them (the game's Edit mode does not move the keeper). Make GK
  swaps the selected starter with the keeper in the starting eleven only; the formation's
  slots stay.
- **A preset copy or swap moves the whole preset**, man marking included (4ccEditor's preset
  holds no man marking, so its copy leaves the target's): the game's own copy preset is how
  members bring a match's man marking into a team (DECISIONS 2026-10-12), so the copy carries
  it. A formation copy or swap moves the eleven slots' position, X and Y within the shown
  preset; the starting eleven is the team's and stays.
- **A pitch player dropped on another** swaps the two on the pitch: their two slots exchange
  position, X and Y in the shown formation of the shown preset alone, each player staying in
  his slot, as the game's drag does in Team Sheet/Edit Position (a save written after one
  changed only those two slots of that one formation). The keeper is never a target, his
  slot's position and spot being fixed. The game's other swap, selecting one starter and then
  the other, exchanges the two players in the starting eleven, so it reaches every formation of
  every preset; the editor's is an XI row dropped on another row or on a pitch marker, or a
  pitch marker dropped on an XI row. One
  released on the grass moves to the snapped drop point, his position set by the rule below,
  and one released off the pitch stays where he was. The game also changes the position of a dragged
  player (an AMF dragged lower becomes a DMF), but not by fixed areas of the pitch: the same
  spot gives different positions depending on who is dragged and where his teammates stand (a
  dragged LMF reads AMF at a spot where a dragged CMF reads LMF; the LMF turns CMF about 11.5
  short of the nearest CMF, wherever that CMF stands), and the area the screen lights while he
  is held is not where his position changes. A rule fitted to scans would guess, and its wrong
  guesses would set positions silently, so the rule is read from the game's code: PES 2016's
  executable, the last one that is not packed, then checked in PES 2021, where it reproduces
  the four scans and the Select Position menu. Each position has an area of the pitch, its
  rectangle in each of PES 2016's two tables (the second widens the first to the pitch's
  edges, x 0 and 104 and y 48), a point inside either counting; CF's starts at stored y 40,
  confirmed in PES 2021. Below, "rectangle" means that area. A dropped point
  offers two positions: the band's default (the first of CB, CMF, SS whose rectangle holds
  the point) and the first free one of LB, RB, DMF, LMF, RMF, AMF, LWF, RWF, CF, CB, SS holding
  it, where a central position is always free and a wide one (LB, RB, LMF, RMF, LWF, RWF) only
  while no other slot of the formation holds it. He keeps his current position when it is one
  of the two (or the point offers neither); otherwise he takes the one his own per-position
  overall rates higher, the default on a tie. So a point inside his position's rectangle does
  not always keep it: a second LMF dragged within LMF's rectangle is offered CMF alone, the
  other LMF holding the wide one. His teammates' spots never enter it. A slot whose roster
  row has no overalls (an empty slot) keeps his position: no overall, no pick. The overall is PES 2016's formula on every version, no other version's being read: PES
  2021's differs from it by up to 2 (93 of 201 points read in game differ, 12 of them by 2),
  so where the two candidates' overalls are within 2 the editor's pick can differ from the
  game's. The formula is `pes_savefile`'s, on its player model (a player's abilities and
  positions and a position in, the overall out): twenty abilities weighted per position,
  the position's bonus (registered, A, B; C none), and at the registered position, a
  keeper's aside, a blend with the first nineteen abilities' mean through a lookup table,
  clamped to 40-109. The two keeper terms are each the mean of a few keeper abilities; PES
  2015 stores no clearing, reflexes or coverage, so its means take the ones it stores rather
  than counting the missing ones as 0, which would sink every PES 2015 keeper (one keeper
  ability at 0 takes a 70 keeper to the floor of 40).
  Its weights, bonuses and lookup are PES 2016's tables, a measurement
  hand-written by the lead; which ability each weight reads is inferred from its profile
  (the code reads them unnamed), and the two alternatives tried (kicking power and swerve
  swapped, physical contact for body control) change no overall read in PES 2017 or 2021.
  One function serves the drop's rule and the badge's number; the host hands
  `team_widgets` each starter's thirteen per-position overalls in his `RosterRow`, since
  the widgets read no player record. PES 2017,
  the game DBC7 plays, follows both exactly: ten rectangle edges crossed by six players
  dragged in its Lineup/Edit Position (CF's y 40 among them) fall where PES 2016's tables put
  them, and PES 2016's formula gives every one of 150 overalls read there (23 players, nine
  positions, registered, A and C), so its drag is the rule as it stands. A lineup row released on the grass
  does nothing, as in the draft: a row moves players between the lists, never on the pitch.
  While a dragged starter is held over another, that one carries the selected player's corner
  brackets (`#14fbff`), drawn over everything, and the dragged marker goes to 35% opacity over
  him, so a drag meant only to move a player shows the swap before the release and can be
  steered off it onto the grass. The dragged marker's own spot is never the target: the drop
  hits the marker drawn on top among the others, so the mark and the release always agree.
- **A held starter** moves a whole stored unit at a time (2.8 points across, 6.8 down),
  standing where a release would put him, and the point of his marker first pressed stays
  under the pointer: the press's offset from his badge centre is kept for the whole drag, so
  a press on his portrait or name does not jump his badge onto the pointer. At each step his
  badge shows the position a release there gives him and his overall at it: the drop rule
  above at his spot, from the position he had when picked up, never from the one shown a
  step earlier, so moving him back restores it (a CF dragged down to AMF and back up is a CF
  again, as in PES 2017; ruled from the step before, he passed SS's rows on the way back and
  stayed an SS). Over a teammate the badge shows the teammate's position, which a release
  there gives him (the game's badge does the same). The release writes the spot and that
  position, one undoable edit, and only a release commits one: a CF released as an AMF and
  dragged back up is a CF again where his overall rates CF over SS, while one released in
  SS's rows stays an SS in CF's area, SS being offered there.
  While he is held, the pitch outside the areas of the positions he is rated A or B at is
  darkened to 40% (the turf and its lines; the markers are drawn over it), as the game lights
  it: each lit area is its position's rectangle in the first table, its edges half a unit
  out from its rows through the spot mapping, a row at the table's edge (x 5 or 99, y 47)
  reaching the canvas' edge. The darkening is painted as the cells the lit edges cut the
  canvas into, each filled once when no lit rectangle holds it, so overlapping rectangles (a
  band's and a smaller area inside it) never darken twice. These are the PES 2021 screen's edges within 1.5 points but for CF's lower one, which
  the screen draws at y 40.7 where the table's row starts at 40: the editor draws the table's,
  y 39.5, where a CF stops being offered, since the screen's own geometry for that edge is not
  read. The lit area says where he is rated, not where his position changes: the rule decides
  that, from every position's area and his overalls.
- **A starter swapped with a bench player** hands the bench player every set-piece role, the
  joining of the attack and every preset's instruction targets the starter held; the captain
  stays who he was, as in 4ccEditor.

Version quirks (advanced-instruction ranges differ 17 vs 18+) are enforced by the
`pes_savefile` model, not the UI; a `.4cct` imports into any version `TeamToml::apply`'s
version rule admits (`spec/pes_savefile/operations.md` "Team TOML"), not only into 16-18 as
4ccEditor's did.

## `libs/team_widgets`

The tactics editor above, the skill/COM/playstyle pickers of the player view, and the AATF
violations list are not this tool's alone: the [Team creator](team_creator.md) shows the same
formation, cards and instructions to a new manager over a team that does not exist in any save
yet. Tool crates never depend on tool crates (core plan, guardrail 1), so the widgets live in a
lib — `libs/team_widgets`, an egui widget crate in the class the core plan already allows for
`color_tools` and `model_viewport`: egui-dependent, `wasm32`-clean, and nothing else but
`studio_core`'s shared widgets (the checkbox every view draws), so its controls look as the
host's do.

Contract, the same one the color picker has: a widget takes `&mut` model (`TeamEntry`,
`TacticsPreset`, `PlayerEntry` — `pes_savefile`'s types), the version's schema for gating, and the
AATF rules where it shows limits; it draws, and it returns what changed. It never sees a session,
an undo stack, a file, or a savefile byte. The host decides what an edit means: this editor pushes
it onto the undo stack, the creator writes it into its draft.

Contents:

- `pitch` — the drag-and-drop formation canvas, position labels and snapping, the per-slot detail
  popover, lineup and bench lists with swap-by-drag.
- `tactics` — preset selector, sliders, style toggles, advanced instructions (with target-player
  pick), set-piece role palette, auto flags, click-to-assign modes.
- `cards` — skill, COM-style and playstyle pickers, version-gated, with one remaining-count badge:
  the player's own tier as the host's AATF rules file reads him (`player_tier`, then that tier's
  `card_limits`), or `No tier matches`; the host computes both and passes the one badge, so the
  widget never recognizes a tier itself. The playing styles are listed in the order the
  version stores them, which is the game's own Edit-mode list, not the canonical order the
  Team TOML names them in: a member compares the combo against the game's list.
- `violations` — the AATF results list grouped per player, emitting a "selected" event for the
  host's jump-to that names the row's player and its violation (the host lands a
  `FieldedNotA` one on the team row, its preset shown). The groups keep `check_team`'s order (the players by slot, then the team's
  own rows), each group's errors before its warnings; a team header heads each team's rows;
  suggestions are drawn only when the host asks, in their own group after the violations. A row
  is the rule's name as a rules file writes it and a sentence saying what is wrong; the
  sentences are the widget's, one per `ViolationKind`, so both hosts word a violation alike
  (the CLI prints the name and the fields only, `aatf`'s `ViolationKind::rule`, which both use).

Stock-formation constants stay in the Team creator (its only consumer) until this editor wants
an "apply stock formation" action, at which point they move here.

## Full Player Customization (FPC)

FPC is the 4cc system for fielding **FBMs (Full Body Models)**, custom models that replace
the player's entire body; the system and its presets are specified with `libs/fpc`
([spec](../spec/libs/fpc.md)).

The editor's side of this, ported from `fpc.cpp`: a per-player toggle and a
team-wide on/off that apply `libs/fpc`'s FPC enable/disable
presets (their fields are listed in the [libs/fpc spec](../spec/libs/fpc.md)); the strip settings
that break or bend hiding (inners, undershorts, taping, the gloves checkbox) are reported by
its interference rules in the Appearance section, not cleared. The same presets serve the
[Team compiler's](team_compiler/README.md) per-player-folder `fpc_on`/`fpc_off` marker
files, so the editor's toggle and the compiler's markers cannot drift apart.

- **The hide IDs are a common setting.** Any boots or gloves ID the game has no model for
  hides the body; 55 and 11 are the 4cc convention, not a game fact. So the two IDs are
  common settings (`fpc_hide_boots_id`, `fpc_hide_gloves_id`, defaults 55 and 11; core plan
  "Settings menu"), and `libs/fpc`'s hide preset takes them as an `fpc::HideIds` value rather
  than reading constants: the editor's Hide default body, Show default body, Ctrl+I, the team's Set and Remove
  FPC invisibility and the classifier (`is_fpc_player`) read the setting, and so do the
  compiler's `fpc_on` marker and its default-ID rule. One setting, not one per tool: a
  compiler writing 60 for a marker and an editor reading only 55 as hidden would show every
  compiled FPC player as "The default body is currently shown". A hide ID is valid in the stock band only, boots 1 to
  100 and gloves 11 to 100: above 100 the compiler allocates its per-team blocks (an ID there
  would be another player's real model), and gloves 1 to 10 are the goalkeepers' real gloves.
  Whether an ID in the band exists in a given game is the member's knowledge, as it is for
  55 today. Changing the setting does not rewrite a save: a player hidden with the old ID
  reads "The default body is currently shown" afterwards, and Show default body leaves his ID alone (it is no longer the hide
  ID); the help says so.

- **A model's own IDs are kept.** The wiki's hide list reads "Boots 55 (or any other
  nonexistent boots ID), or your FBM's custom boots if it uses that", and the compiler keeps a
  `settings.toml`'s own `boots_id` over the marker's (TC-BIN-29). So the editor writes a
  preset's boots or gloves ID only where the record holds 0 or the hide preset's ID, and keeps
  any other: hiding turns 0 into 55 and keeps 627, showing turns 55 into 0 and keeps 627
  (55 standing for the configured hide ID, above).
  4ccEditor's `enable_fpc_invis_for_player` and `disable_fpc_invis_for_player` do the same.
  On PES 15 to 17 they also set the Custom skin when hiding; Hide default body does not, since the
  wiki's full hide sets no skin and the Custom skin is its partial hide's setting (both tools'
  Show default body give such a player the Light skin back, so the two converge).
- **Hide and Show, not a checkbox.** A player hidden by his model's own boots ID reads as not
  hidden to `is_fpc_player`, which sees only the save (the hide ID or a custom skin),
  so a checkbox drawn from it would stay unticked after a click and could never show him
  again. The Appearance section draws the classifier's reading ("The default body is currently hidden" or
  "The default body is currently shown") with two actions, Hide default body and Show default body; Ctrl+I shows a player the classifier
  reads as hidden and hides any other, and the Team menu's Set and Remove FPC invisibility are
  the same two actions over the team.
- **The findings are catalog codes.** `fpc::check`'s five codes are rows of the tool's message
  catalog (`fpc_inners_break_hiding`, `fpc_undershorts_break_hiding`, `fpc_taping_shows_pieces`,
  `fpc_gloves_checkbox_winter_gloves`, `fpc_custom_skin_on_non_fpc`), so the section's text and the
  help's Messages topic are one; they join the spec's Messages table when this phase closes.
  The last never fires here: the save's classifier counts a custom skin as hidden, so only the
  compiler, which classifies by the folder's marker, can meet it.

## Read-only aesthetics

A player's aesthetics are owned by the team's export: `settings.toml` and the models decide them.
On Fox the Team compiler writes them into the database tables of its CPK and the savefile's
appearance records are stripped (see "Stripped save" below); on pre-Fox it resolves them into an
**aesthetics patch** (format in "Aesthetics patch" of the
[Savefile plan](pes_savefile/operations.md)), and the save editor
applies the patch. Hand-editing the same fields here
would create the two-sources problem — the next patch silently overwrites the hand edit, or the
hand edit silently diverges from the DLC. That holds for a cup whose looks this suite's Team
compiler builds; a cup whose save is the looks' home (DBC7: PES 17, compiled with the old
tooling) edits them in the save as 4ccEditor did. So the lock is a setting of the Save
editor's section, **"Aesthetics from exports"** (`aesthetics_from_exports`), **off by
default**: off, every aesthetics path below edits as 4ccEditor's did, with no ownership line
and no switch drawn; on, the editor **does not edit aesthetics** but through the switch:

- The Appearance section renders its values below the Cutscenes group disabled, with one line of explanation ("The team's
  export owns the aesthetics, so edit its `settings.toml` (the face, hair and iris: its
  `ingame_face.toml`) and recompile", plus on pre-Fox ", then apply the patch" and a link to the apply action).
- The same lock covers every other aesthetics write path: the team operations that write
  appearance fields (set boots/gloves IDs for everyone, set/remove FPC for the team, clear visual
  flags, the FPC toggle), Fix database (it clears the same flags), and the aesthetics section of Team TOML and
  legacy squad imports (the section checkbox is disabled, gameplay and tactics import as before).
- **Apply aesthetics patch** is the one aesthetics write open by default: open a patch; the
  version must match the save and the allocation scheme the suite's (refused otherwise, save
  untouched); the comparator's preview lists every player the patch will change with old → new;
  applied through the undo pipeline; saved only when the user saves. A team the save lacks is
  reported and skipped; the rest applies. Patches apply cleanly in sequence — a midcup patch
  carries only the teams it recompiled and only the fields their compile resolved.
- **Unlock: "Edit aesthetics anyway"**, a switch in the Appearance section, drawn only while the
  setting is on, off at every start of the tool. Turning it on re-enables all the paths above for the session, with the note that on
  pre-Fox a later patch overwrites whatever is edited by hand, and on a stripped Fox save the game
  takes the player's look from the database tables and reads only his motions (they sit before
  the appearance block). It exists for the cases the rule does not cover — a
  team with no export, a cup-night fix when recompiling is not an option — and it is a session
  switch rather than a second setting so that a machine set to "Aesthetics from exports" cannot
  quietly stay unlocked. The setting is off by default because the cup the suite serves first
  (DBC7) keeps its looks in the save; a stripped player's mark shows in both states, so an
  edit the game will not read is never silent. Its row in the settings menu carries the
  tooltip "On when the cup's looks are compiled from exports: the save's aesthetics are then
  read-only, behind Edit aesthetics anyway in the Appearance section."

Gameplay data (stats, skills, positions), team data and tactics are unaffected: they were never
the compiler's, and the savefile builder edits them as before.

---

## Stripped save

What exists of this is in `spec/save_editor.md` "Stripped save".

- The GUI parts of its rules: `.4ccs`/`.4cct` and Texport imports leave the appearance block's
  id as it is, as every import does; the unlocked Appearance section writes the record's fields but
  not its id, and on a stripped save it says that the look comes from the tables and the motions
  are still read; every reader of a
  record's appearance in the GUI (the Appearance section, the FPC classifier and its interference
  findings) marks a player at -1 as stripped beside what it shows; `settings.toml` generation
  and Generate in-game face skip him ("Player settings in exports" in the
  [Aesthetics export plan](aesthetics_export/settings_toml.md)); opening a Fox save lists the
  players whose appearance id is set while others are stripped, with a one-click **Strip
  again** (their record is ignored from then on; the tables decide).

---

## Comparator (gameplay + aesthetics)

What exists of this is in `spec/save_editor.md` "Comparator (gameplay + aesthetics)".

The panel over the spec's `diff` report:

- Load a second save (same version); the panel lists per-team, per-player
  differences.
- Filter toggles: All / Gameplay / Aesthetics; a team filter; export the diff as
  text.
- Clicking a diff row jumps to that player in the editor.
- A row is drawn in the views' terms: the field under the label its view draws, its value as
  that view shows it (a free-kick motion 15, where the save stores 14), a field no view shows
  keeping the
  report's name and value. Export writes the CLI's report unchanged, stored values included.
  Not the report's values on screen, because a member reads a row against the view it jumps to,
  and a motion one lower than the view's reads as a wrong row; not view values in the report,
  because the report is what the compare scripts it replaces print.
- The picked save is the report's first and the open save its second, so a row reads picked →
  open: what the member's edits changed against the save he compares with.
- Export writes the report of the toggled scope over the whole save, the text `save-editor diff
  <picked> <open>` prints with `--gameplay` or `--aesthetics` (All: neither); the team filter
  narrows the screen only. Not the rows shown, because the command has no team filter, and an
  Export no command writes could not be checked against the CLI.
- The views' terms (a field's label, its stored-to-shown transform) are read from the views'
  own tables, not from a second table for the panel, which would drift from the views; the
  unsaved-changes prompt reads the same ones.
- The rows of the players both saves hold group per team: a player under the first team in
  the open save's order whose roster holds him (`No team` when none does), as the Strip again list names a player's team,
  not one heading per roster, which would repeat a player on a club and a national team; one
  group per team, in the open save's team order (the team selector's), its players in the
  report's order, `No team` after the teams: not a heading at each change along the report's
  order, which heads a team once per run of its players, and a real save's teams hold ids far
  apart; his
  stripped mark beside his head; the players only in one save last, under `Only in the picked
  save` and `Only in the open save`, as the report lists them. The comparison runs on a worker
  thread, the held list marked `Comparing…` until it lands, and a frame draws only the rows in
  view: two real PES 2021 saves differ in 34,379 rows (about half a second for the command).
- Another save opened keeps the pick and compares it again (a member compares several saves
  against one reference), refused as any pick is when the versions differ.

## Aesthetics transplant

Built after Release 0.1.0 (0.2.0 or later); 0.0.1 and 0.1.0 ship without it.

A team's looks copied from a save into the team's export, the files the Team compiler compiles
from, never into a save: aesthetics live in the exports, and a look written into a save is one the
next compile overwrites or a stripped Fox save does not read. Midcupping's save-to-save transplant
is not kept, in the window or on the command line: its one remaining use, a team with no export,
is served by generating the export from the save ("Interchange formats in the UI",
`settings.toml` generation) and editing it there.

- Pick a donor save, then one of its teams by name (a combo that also takes typing).
- The team's roster as checkboxes, one per filled slot, `NN name` (the slot, 01-23, and the
  display name): the roster slot is what identifies a player, as it names his folder in the
  export (`NN - Name` or a root `players.txt`); shirt numbers are free text and identify nobody.
- The target is that team's own export in the exports folder, found the way the Team compiler
  finds a team's export; each checked slot's player folder in it. Cross-team copies are out of
  scope (a member copies the TOML files by hand). A missing export or a checked slot with no
  folder refuses the whole run before anything is written, naming what is missing.
- Each target folder's `settings.toml` and `ingame_face.toml` are updated in place through
  `toml_edit` (only the keys the donor's look carries are written; comments and every other key
  stay), created when the folder has none; the keys and values are the ones `settings.toml`
  generation writes for the same player.
- **Preview before writing**: every file listed with the keys it changes, old → new, so a wrong
  team or slot is visible before it does damage.
- Not under "Read-only aesthetics": writing the export is where a look is meant to change.

---

## Interchange formats in the UI

The formats themselves are specified in the [Savefile plan](pes_savefile/README.md);
the editor exposes them as:

- **Team TOML export/import** per team (the `.4ccs`/`.4cct` successor: complete
  team + tactics + players including full aesthetics and ingame-face data).
  Import goes onto the team selected in the editor and offers the same section choices as
  4ccEditor's squad load (gameplay / aesthetics / tactics), and applies cross-version conversion with a warning list
  when the file's version differs. The sections split the file as the squad load does: names,
  shirt names and shirt numbers go with aesthetics (its `PlayerImport` copies them under
  `importAes`), not with gameplay as the comparator's scopes have them, and so do nationality,
  age, every motion but the free kick's, the dribbling motion and the base-copy flag and id;
  the free-kick motion, height, weight, star, playing attitude and stronger hand go with
  gameplay (`editor.h` `PlayerImport`, read 2026-10-21), so a file that loads
  with 4ccEditor's choices loads the same here. The file's `[team]` keys, which the squad file
  never carried, go with gameplay.
- **Legacy import**: `.4ccs` and `.4cct` open through the same import dialog,
  read-only.
- **Texport import/export** (export is new; PES itself can import the file). Export writes
  PES 18-21 files from `Texport::new`'s templates; on a PES 15-17 save it is disabled, its
  tooltip saying those versions have no template (`spec/pes_savefile/operations.md`
  "Texport (read + write)").
- **Aesthetics patch apply** — see "Read-only aesthetics"; the patch is written by the Team
  compiler, never by the editor.
- **`settings.toml` generation** — per player folder, for migrating a team to the
  [Team compiler](team_compiler/README.md)'s compile-time aesthetics (on Fox the CPK's database
  tables, on pre-Fox savefile writing). Uses the
  shared authorable `PlayerSettings` subset; boots/gloves IDs are emitted only when they name a
  stock model (1 to 100), since custom IDs are compiler-assigned from models/links, not export
  settings.
  Full Team TOML remains a full-fidelity save interchange. Name handling: the editor
  generates without a folder, so it writes the save's strings (`name = true` is the
  Export upgrader's rule) — in particular a
  name carrying colour codes is always emitted as the explicit string, so the
  next compile preserves the codes. The face, hair and iris keys are not in it: a second
  action, **Generate in-game face**, writes them into the folder's `ingame_face.toml`, since
  the save cannot say which players wear the in-game face: the cup keeps every "modified
  face" flag off, the game choosing the face folder whenever one exists for the id
  (`spec/aesthetics_export/player_folders.md` "`ingame_face` marker"), so the member who
  knows the folder picks (SE-GUI-33, 34). Both are Player-menu items on the selected player, each a dialog with the folder
  (typed or picked, never guessed: the save does not know which export or folder name a
  player has), the file's text as it will be written, and Write. A `settings.toml` already in
  the folder is updated in place (`update_toml`: its comments and layout kept, the values the
  record's), since user-facing TOML is edited, never regenerated; `ingame_face.toml` is
  written whole, its values all the record's and its comments the template's, so there is
  nothing of the member's to keep. A `settings.toml` there that does not parse is shown as
  the error and nothing is written, rather than replaced by the template.

---

## Configurable AATF rules

What exists of this is in `spec/save_editor.md` "Configurable AATF rules".

What this editor adds on top of the lib:

- **The ruleset dropdown** (`spec/save_editor.md` "Configurable AATF rules" for what is
  built): the wheel over the closed combo (`core/gui.md` "The wheel over a value") steps the
  rulesets alone, never running `Import rules file…`, which is a command rather than a value.
- **Quick actions.** Under the player list, in two columns (the draft's `quickActions`):
  one button per
  tier of the active ruleset, the medal tiers on the left and the others on the right, each in
  its order ("Editing UI": Make Gold / Silver / Bronze, then Goalkeeper / Regular under the
  official one), each `aatf::apply_tier` on the selected player as one undoable edit;
  then Set stats with its number, the Player menu's Set all stats in one click (40 to 99). An
  `apply_tier` that fails (`CheckError`) leaves the player as he was and shows the error in
  the refusal dialog.
- **Live AATF.** A toolbar toggle, off by default and remembered in the tool's settings
  (`live_aatf`), for a member who has built the team and is now making it legal. On, a panel
  docked at the bottom of the view lists the violations of the team the view is editing (the
  selected row's team, else the selector's), errors first, grouped per
  player under a line naming him, the team's own under `Team-wide issues`, then, while **Show
  suggestions** is on, under a `Suggestions` heading, the team's unused allowances (`Unused`
  rows, `only 4 of 5 cards used`). Show suggestions is a checkbox right of the toggle, drawn only while Live
  AATF is on, off by default and remembered (`live_suggestions`); on, the check asks for the
  suggestions, so a player whose list mark is blue has his reason in the dock, and off, no
  blue mark is drawn anywhere: a suggestion is no failure, and most players of a cup team
  have an allowance unused (in the PES 17 sample under the official rules, most of the two checked teams' players, for
  their free tricks), so unasked they would tint the whole list. The header reads `N issues · <ruleset>`, counting
  errors and warnings, or `<team> passes <ruleset> with no issues.` once neither is left;
  clicking a row selects that player (a
  `FieldedNotA` row selects his team's row instead, the named preset shown on the first of
  its formations that carries the cross, since the pitch its mark is on is the team
  view's). The
  team is re-checked after every edit to it, undo and redo included, and when another team is
  opened, so the list shrinks as the member fixes it. One team's check takes about 56 ms in a
  release build, nearly all of it the script's own work (`spec/aatf_rules.md` "The host"),
  more than a frame, so it runs on a worker, on the ruleset the window loaded, once the edit
  settles (a drag released, a field committed) and the list keeps the previous result, marked
  as checking, until the new one arrives. The panel is the log panel widget's frame (its chevron collapses it to the header,
  its divider resizes it). At the bottom, not at a side: the player list holds the left and the
  views need their width (the player view's three columns), and a bottom strip is where the Team compiler's
  log already sits. The toggle is drawn as a button, framed, its label a play sign (`▶`, U+25B6,
  from the bundled emoji fonts the marks' glyphs come from) then `Live AATF` whether on or
  off, filled in the accent colour when on: the fill says on, and a check mark beside the
  label read as on even while it was off. egui's toggle value is a selectable label, which
  off reads as a label beside the menus, and the toggle is how a manager finds the check at
  all. While it is on, its result also marks the editor itself, so a manager sees what to fix
  where they fix it:
  - **The player list** marks each listed player of the checked team, at the row's right end
    after its unsaved-changes dot: a cross (`✖`, U+2716) in the error colour on a player with
    an Error-severity row, else a check mark (`✔`, U+2714; warnings and suggestions are not
    failures, as `check-aatf`'s exit code counts them), in the warning orange when one of his
    rows is a Warning, in the link blue when his rows are suggestions alone, in the success
    colour when he has none; both glyphs are the suite's symbols font's. Its tooltip the
    player's rows as the dock counts them, a zero count left out (`2 errors, 1 warning`,
    `1 suggestion`), and `No errors` when he has none. Players of other teams, with ALL
    picked, carry none: they are not checked. The team's own rows (no slot) mark the team's
    row the same way.
  - **The field a row is about** gets a mark when its player is selected (the pitch's, when
    his team's row is: the pitch is the team view's), for the highest severity among its
    rows: a cross (`✖`) in the error colour for an Error, a warning sign (`⚠`, U+26A0) in the
    warning orange for a Warning, a circled i (`ⓘ`, U+24D8) in the link blue for suggestions
    alone, all three the symbols font's (`ⓘ` drawn for it in the warning sign's stroke and
    height, so the two read as one family; a plain `!` and `i` were too slight to see). Not
    the list's check marks: on a field a check would read as "this field passes", which a
    field with a row does not. Every mark is drawn in an 11-point box, the widest glyph's (the
    warning sign, 10.6 at 12.5), its glyph centred, so a column's marks line up by their
    centres. The
    mark's box stands left of the field's label, 2 points from its text,
    drawn outside the label's box over the margin before it, so no label moves or wraps
    (after the label, the Registered position and `Weak foot: Usage` labels wrapped to a
    second line) and the marks of a column of labels line up whatever the labels' lengths:
    General info's and Other stats' labels; an ability stat's at its label cell's left edge
    instead (over the cell's padding), the labels there being right-aligned, so the stats'
    marks still share one column; a panel's header for a row about the panel as a whole (the positions grid, the skills, the
    Tricks or Free cards panel, the COM styles). The Skills header's Cards left badge has no
    mark of its own: its rows mark the Skills header, the group holding the card counts, in
    one mark with the skills' own (the highest severity of both, both in its tooltip), since
    a mark in the row before the badge would shift the badge whenever it showed. The first
    column's marks stand in the gap after the list, which General info's inset widens
    enough ("The player view"). The fields: the Height
    box for `Height`, the Age, Weight, Form, Injury resistance and weak foot fields for
    theirs, the stat for `Stat`, the name for `NameColor`, the registered position for
    `RegisteredNotA` and `PositionRange`, the positions grid for `BRating`, `GkSecondA` and
    `APositions`, the player's spot on the named preset's Tactics pitch for `FieldedNotA`
    (drawn while the team view shows that preset, on each formation the preset fields that puts
    him at the violation's `position`: a fluid preset fields all three, and its others may
    field him legally; a preset not fluid fields its kick-off one alone, so its other two
    carry no cross; an X over his whole portrait, its two strokes in the severity's colour
    inside a thin black outline that keeps it seen over a red portrait, where a field's
    glyph beside the badge was barely seen, and painted after every marker, since a marker
    drawn later can cover his portrait with its own),
    the playing style
    for `PlayingStyleRange`, the skills for `SkillCardCap`, the COM styles for
    `ComStyleCap`, the skills or the COM styles for `RequiredCard` by its card's kind, the
    Skills header for `Cards` and `MinCards` (the Cards left badge's), which no one field causes:
    `Cards`' budget counts every card kind and the extra A positions, `MinCards`' count the
    paid skills and the extra A positions; and for a suggestion (`Unused`), the field of its
    allowance: the Skills header for the cards, the positions grid for the A positions,
    the `Weak foot: Usage` label for the weak foot (the pair's shared label), the Injury
    resistance field, the Height field for the height (a player below his `up_to`
    bracket's top could be taller), the COM styles for `com`, the Tricks or Free cards panel for the tricks
    and the free cards, and the skills for any other card group. A field several rows are
    about carries one mark, its tooltip their lines as the dock shows them, one per
    line. One function maps a kind to its field, a match with an arm per kind (a new kind does
    not compile past it); the kinds about no single field (`NoTier`, `StatTotal`, `Special`,
    `Custom`, `RosterOrder`) mark the player's row alone, and the team-level ones the team's.
    A field the view does not show (the Appearance section closed, another preset's
    pitch) carries its mark when shown.
  - While a check is in flight the marks keep the previous result, as the list does. A check
    that fails (a script error in the rules file) clears every mark: the dock shows the
    failure, and a mark from an older result would claim a check that no longer ran.
---

## Build order and verification

`pes_savefile` (codec, model, conversions, fingerprint ops, interchange
formats, comparator, FPC invisibility) is built in Phase 2 as a standalone lib; the
editor's non-UI substance a command drives — the tool crate's settings, CLI and the `session/`
operations its commands run, plus the `aatf` rules engine — lands in Phase 5; the view lands
in Phase 8 with the `session/` wiring only it drives (undo, selection, recent files, the FPC
toggle, AATF quick actions), each built in the slice that uses it (see the
[core plan](core/development_plan.md#development-plan)). Within Phase 8, the draft comes first:
`docs/prototypes/tools/save_editor.js` (`core/gui.md` "Prototypes before implementation") shows
the master-detail layout, every view and every panel of the five slices below with sample data,
and is refined with the maintainer; a slice that changes what the draft shows changes the draft
first. It is the third arrangement (step 0.0.1s, "Editing UI"): no tabs, a team row per team
and the team view, the player's fields in three columns, Appearance a collapsed section; the
second's (the team bar above every tab, the Player / Team tab groups) was built in slices 1-3
and 8.9f's slice 4, and is ported to the third in step 0.0.1s3. The arrangements' panels and
dialogs are the same, function for function. The view builds up as:

1. Open/save + the player's fields (abilities and skills, appearance) — the card pickers as the
   first `team_widgets` content
2. The team's fields + batch operations + FPC
3. Tactics editor in `team_widgets` (pitch canvas last — everything else works without it)
4. The Comparator panel and Live AATF (the transplant after Release 0.1.0)
5. Interchange format dialogs (Team TOML, legacy import, Texport, settings.toml)

Verification:

- Field-level parity: the same save opened in 4ccEditor and in the new editor
  must display identical values for every field, all versions (spot-checked per
  panel; automated for the codec layer in `pes_savefile`'s roundtrip tests).
- Batch operations and Fix database compared against 4ccEditor's output on the
  same input save (byte-diff of the decrypted payload).
- AATF: the official ruleset's parity with `aatf.cpp` and the rest of the AATF rules plan's
  "Development phase and verification".
- Comparator output parity against the Midcupping scripts, its aesthetics scope against
  the transplant script's byte slice.
- Texport export verified by importing into the game (manual, per version).

## Acceptance

What exists of this is in `spec/save_editor.md` "Acceptance", whose rules (format, the fixture
saves, a team or player named by its id in them) these scenarios follow; IDs continue the
spec's numbering.

**Phase 8 scope.** Phase 8 delivers the view and the `session/` wiring only it drives (undo,
selection, recent files, the FPC toggle, AATF quick actions), in the five slices of "Build
order and verification". What a scenario observes is what a frame draws, through the headless
harness (the frame's AccessKit nodes, a click or a drag as pointer frames, keyboard shortcuts
as key events; a color, which no AccessKit node carries, is read back from the view state the
frame paints from), the file written by Save, and the session's model; `manual` marks only
what needs a display, a native dialog or a running game. "The save" is the fixture save of
the version named, PES 21 unless the scenario says otherwise, copied under the test's own
folder; save discovery is pointed at a Documents folder under that folder, never the
developer's. An operation's outcome in the file is its own specification's where one exists
(a patch's, `SE-PAT`; a tier's values, `spec/aatf_rules.md`
`apply_tier`; a Team TOML's, the CLI's export); these scenarios observe that the view reaches
the same operation and shows its result. The operations with no command, which the spec's
Phase 5 scope left to the view (the quick actions, the player and team operations, the
tactics copies, the Texport and legacy imports, generation), get theirs here.

```
SE-GUI-01  GIVEN the save
           WHEN it is opened from the view (Open, or its entry in the discovered-saves list)
           THEN the team selector lists its teams and ALL, the player list shows each player's
                number, position and name with the name's color codes rendered as colors under
                its team's row, and the player view's first line is the selected player's id
                and name, its color codes rendered as colors, over his General info fields
SE-GUI-02  GIVEN the PES 17 save open on team 701
           WHEN a name, shirt name or id of a player of another team is typed in the filter box
           THEN the list shows the matching players across all teams, matched on the
                color-code-free display name, and selecting one shows him
SE-GUI-03  GIVEN the save open
           WHEN a player's ability value is edited in the player view
           THEN his list entry carries the unsaved-changes dot, the file is unchanged until Save
                (Ctrl+S or the button), and after Save the reopened file holds the value with
                the dot gone
SE-GUI-04  GIVEN two edits made in order
           WHEN Undo is invoked, then Redo
           THEN the second edit's field returns to its earlier value and the first's stays,

SE-GUI-05  GIVEN the save open with unsaved changes
           WHEN the window is closed, or another save opened
           THEN a prompt offers to save, discard or cancel over a table of the changes, one
                row per changed field (GIVEN a player's Height and Speed edited and a third
                field edited then undone THEN two rows, each naming him and the field with its
                old and new value as the view shows them); cancel leaves the session as it
                was; save writes the edits to the open file, then closes or opens the other
                save; discard closes or opens it and the open file is unchanged; GIVEN the
                Team compiler's view active when the window is closed THEN the close waits,
                the Save editor becomes the active view and shows the same prompt

           THEN the stronger hand control (General info) and the star and playing attitude
                controls (Appearance's Cutscenes group) are disabled with a tooltip naming the
                first version that has them, in the same place as on a PES 21 save, where they
                are enabled
SE-GUI-07  GIVEN the save open with "Aesthetics from exports" on
           WHEN the Appearance section is drawn open

                team's export owns them, the Cutscenes group's editable (and
                on pre-Fox, the patch step); WHEN "Edit aesthetics anyway" is switched on THEN
                they are editable, the switch is off again at the next start of the tool, and on
                a stripped player the section says his look comes from the database tables and his
                motions are still read
SE-GUI-08  GIVEN the save open on a team
           WHEN player 02 is dragged above player 01 in the list
           THEN the list shows the new order, and after Save slot 01 still holds player
                `team id × 100 + 01`, whose record (name, stats, appearance but the face and
                hair) is the one player 02 had, and the other way round; the roster's ids and shirt numbers are as they
                were, and the AATF check reports no `RosterOrder` error for the team; GIVEN
                ALL picked THEN the same drag has the same outcome, and WHEN player 02 is
                dropped on a row of the next team instead THEN nothing moves
SE-GUI-09  GIVEN the official ruleset active
           WHEN Make Gold is clicked on a player
           THEN his fields hold the Gold tier's values as `aatf::apply_tier` sets them
                (`spec/aatf_rules.md`), as one undoable edit, and check-aatf then reports no
                violation of the Gold tier's targets for him; GIVEN the VTL11 ruleset active
                (bundled, `aatf/rulesets/vtl11.rhai`) THEN the quick actions are Make Gold,
                Silver, Regular and Buffed in that order, no Bronze or Goalkeeper, and Make
                Silver sets VTL11's Silver values (rate 89, not the official 92); WHEN 85 is
                typed into Set stats' number and Set stats clicked THEN every ability stat the
                version has reads 85 and weak foot, form and injury resistance are unchanged,
                as one undoable edit, and a typed 120 settles at 99 (the number is 40 to 99)
SE-GUI-10  GIVEN the save open and a team's row clicked
           WHEN its name, a color or the manager id is edited in the team view, and saved
           THEN the reopened file holds the values; GIVEN #FF8000 picked as color 1 THEN the
                reopened team's color 1 is (63, 32, 0) and the team view shows it as #FF8200,

           WHEN Ctrl+I, or Hide default body, is used
           THEN his record carries the hide preset's values and the Appearance section reads
                "The default body is currently hidden"; Ctrl+I again, or Show default body, gives him the show preset's; GIVEN a player
                whose boots ID is 627 THEN hiding keeps 627; Set FPC invisibility applies the
                hide preset to every player of the team; a strip setting that breaks hiding is
                listed in the Appearance section as an interference finding

           THEN the slot's position is the drop point after snapping, undoable, and the saved
                file holds it; WHEN a bench player is dragged onto a pitch player THEN the two
                swap; WHEN a pitch player is dropped on another on Kick-off THEN the two slots'
                positions and spots are exchanged in preset 1's Kick-off alone, the starting
                eleven, the other two formations and presets 2 and 3 unchanged; WHEN an XI row
                is dropped on another THEN the two players are exchanged in the starting
                eleven, every formation unchanged; WHEN a set-piece role is assigned from the palette THEN the taker field
                holds that player; WHEN "players to join attack" is in its assignment mode and
                two pitch players are clicked THEN those two are the setting's players

           WHEN he is pressed on his portrait and held
           THEN the pitch outside x up to 20.5 from y 15.5 up is darkened, and moving the pointer
                moves his marker a whole unit at a time, the pressed point of his portrait
                under the pointer within a unit; WHEN he is held at (30, 26) THEN his badge
                reads AMF; WHEN he is then released at (19, 20) THEN his slot holds (19, 20)
                and LMF, one undoable edit; WHEN his popover is opened at (20, 26) THEN its
                Position combo lists CMF and LMF alone, and WHEN its Y is set to 36 THEN he is
                an LWF; GIVEN the PES 17 save's team 702 (/a/), its CF COWBOY BEBOP (70223,

                teammates' markers, THEN his badge reads AMF, and WHEN he is held back at
                (40, 45) without a release THEN it reads CF; WHEN he is released at (42, 30)
                THEN he is an AMF, and WHEN he is then dragged to (40, 45) THEN he is a CF;
                WHEN he is instead released at (42, 30), then at (42, 37) (an SS), then
                dragged to (40, 45) THEN he stays an SS
SE-GUI-13  GIVEN the save open and a second save of the same version picked in the comparator

                reports, each row under the label its field's view draws it with and with
                its values as that view shows them (a field no view shows keeps the report's
                name and values); the All / Gameplay / Aesthetics toggles and the team filter
                narrow them; Export writes the text `diff <picked> <open>` prints for the
                toggled scope, whatever the team filter; clicking a row of a player the open

                was; WHEN it picks a clean file named like no built-in THEN the file is copied
                into the data folder's `rules/`, listed under a separator with an × and picked;
                WHEN a file of the same name is imported again THEN a confirmation names the
                import it replaces, and once accepted one row remains; WHEN a file named like a
                built-in is imported THEN it is refused naming the built-in; WHEN the imported
                row's × is clicked and the confirmation accepted THEN its copy is deleted, its

           save
           WHEN it is imported through the game's own team import, in that version
           THEN the game accepts it and the imported team shows the exported squad and names
SE-GUI-30  GIVEN the PES 17 save open on a team with violations under the active ruleset
           WHEN Live AATF is switched on
           THEN the docked panel reads `Checking <team>…` until the first check returns, then
                lists the team's violations under `N issues · <ruleset>`, and clicking a row
                selects that player (a `FieldedNotA` row his team's row, the named preset
                shown on a formation carrying the cross); WHEN an edit fixes one of them THEN the list stays,
                marked `checking…`, until the check returns, its row then gone and N one less,
                and an undo brings it back; WHEN another team is opened, or another ruleset
                picked in the toolbar's dropdown, THEN the list and N are that team's, or that
                ruleset's; the panel checks
                the selected row's team (a player's or a team row's own, another team's
                when the filter lists it), else the selector's (with ALL picked and nothing
                selected: `No team is open.`);
                GIVEN the PES 15 save with a team that passes THEN the header reads `<team>
                passes <ruleset> with no issues.`, and WHEN an edit breaks a rule and the last one is
                fixed THEN it reads so again; WHEN the tool is reopened THEN Live AATF is
                still on
SE-GUI-36  GIVEN SE-GUI-30's save and team, Live AATF on and its first check returned, one
                 player of the team breaking the Height rule alone and another breaking none
           WHEN the view is drawn
           THEN the toolbar's Live AATF is a button whose label holds the play sign, the list
                shows a cross beside the first player and a check mark beside the second; WHEN
                the first is selected THEN a cross stands beside the Height box, its tooltip
                the dock's line for that violation, and no other field carries one; WHEN an edit fixes the
                height and the check returns THEN both marks are a check mark and the cross
                beside the box is gone; WHEN Live AATF is switched off THEN no mark is drawn
SE-GUI-37  GIVEN the PES 17 save open on team 701

           THEN a team row heads the team's players, naming 701 and the team with its colours
                1-2 as swatches; WHEN it is clicked THEN the detail shows the team view (its
                name, short name, colours, manager and stadium ids, the Kit slots… button, the
                Tactics), and the quick actions and the Player menu's entries are disabled, the
                Make buttons' tooltip "The make buttons act on a player: pick a player row";
                WHEN the team's short name is edited THEN the team row carries the unsaved dot
                and none of its players does; WHEN the team row is dragged onto a player row
                THEN nothing moves; WHEN a player row is clicked THEN the player view shows,
                its first line his id then his name, under it General info, Skills and
                Ability stats side by side left to right at the 1280 × 780 window, their tops
                level, and Appearance closed below them; and no view draws "Save editor"

                in the error colour, and its hover the "PES 2019
                and older show 18 letters" sentence; WHEN a letter is deleted from the shirt
                name THEN it reads "Shirt (19/18)", still tinted, and a letter typed after it is
                refused; WHEN another is deleted THEN "(18/18)" is in the warning colour and the
                field untinted, and at "(17/18)" the count is in that grey; WHEN 47 bytes are typed as his name THEN "Name (47/61)", tinted, its hover
                the cut PES 2019 makes; GIVEN the PES 16 save THEN a player's Shirt label's
                limit is 16 and its Name label's 46

                it reads `3-3-1-3`, and WHEN its AMF's position is changed to CMF THEN `3-4-3`,
                and WHEN he is dragged to another spot instead THEN `3-3-1-3` still
SE-GUI-40  GIVEN the PES 21 save open on a player whose registered position is not SS
           WHEN the SS label of his Playable positions is clicked
           THEN his registered position is SS (General info's combo reads it, the SS cell is
                outlined) as one undoable edit, his ratings unchanged; WHEN Undo is invoked
                THEN the earlier position is back
SE-GUI-31  GIVEN the common settings' FPC hide IDs set to 60 (boots) and 12 (gloves), "Edit
                aesthetics anyway" switched on, and the player's Appearance section open

                FPC settings or the Team menu's Set and Remove FPC invisibility run THEN they
                write and clear 60 and 12 the same, and a player holding 55 and 11 keeps them
SE-GUI-32  GIVEN the save open and VTL11 picked in the toolbar's ruleset dropdown (SE-GUI-15)
           WHEN the tool is closed and reopened
           THEN the `aatf_ruleset` setting reads `vtl11`, the tool's other keys unchanged, the

                and `check-aatf` run without `--rules` checks against VTL11; GIVEN the setting
                naming an imported file no longer in the data folder's `rules/` THEN at start
                the ruleset is the first built-in one and a warning notice says so, and no
                quick action, badge or list shows a load error
