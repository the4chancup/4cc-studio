# 4cc Studio — Model conversion plan

Covers the `model_convert` lib crate (the IR plus importers/exporters and skeleton
data) and the format-extension algorithms that live in the `fmdl` and `pes_model`
format crates (mesh splitting, split vertex encoding, anti-blur). Model format
conversion is not a standalone tool — it runs inside the
[Team compiler](../team_compiler/README.md) at compile time, converting models to the target
PES version's format. The glTF + `materials.toml` authoring format that `gltf_to_ir`
reads and `ir_to_gltf` writes is specified in the [Unified model format
plan](../model_format.md). Platform context is in the [core plan](../core/README.md).

---

The plan is split into parts; section headings are unchanged from the
single-file plan.

| Part | Covers |
|---|---|
| [Intermediate representation](ir.md) | Intermediate Representation (IR) |
| [Hand auto-split](hand_split.md) | Hand auto-split |
| [glTF source](gltf.md) | glTF as the universal model source |
| [Model format conversion](conversion.md) | Model Format Conversion |
| [Testing](testing.md) | Testing: IR roundtrips; Testing: conversion against reference outputs |

## Crate layout

The crate is a hub: one IR in the middle, one importer/exporter pair per format around it, and
IR-level operations that never know which format the data came from. The layout enforces the two
boundaries the design depends on — **format code never touches the IR's internals beyond the public
struct, and IR operations never touch a format** — and keeps the format crates (`fmdl`,
`pes_model`) as dependencies, never dependents.

```

Placement rules:

- **`formats/*` are the only modules that import `fmdl`, `pes_model`, or `gltf`**, with one
  named exception: `skeletons/` uses `fmdl::SklFile`, the SKL codec, which lives in `fmdl` only
  because SKL is a Fox-engine file. Everything else sees the IR. A format detail needed by an op is
  a field on the IR, not an import.
- **`ir/` has no logic beyond validation.** Transformations are `ops/`; conversions are `formats/`.
- **`skeletons/` holds no transcribed numbers.** The `.skl` files under `resources/skeletons/` are
  embedded with `include_bytes!` and parsed on first use (`std::sync::LazyLock`); the only
  hand-maintained tables are the render parents and the fold table, both names only. Provenance
  stays with the `.skl` files, never with Python literals. (An earlier version of this plan generated
  a `data.rs` of Rust literals; that is a 250 KB source file plus a generator plus a drift test, for
  data the SKL codec already reads byte-exactly.)
- **`materials/` is shared by all three formats** and by the Blender project's glTF codec contract;
  it must remain independent of `formats/` so the schema can be tested without any model file.
- **Same-format paths do not enter this crate** unless an explicitly planned IR operation is
  requested (hand split, part merge, retargeting); ordinary FMDL→FMDL processing uses the `fmdl`
  crate directly from the Team compiler. This is a consumer-side rule, restated here because the
  temptation is to add a "convenient" pass-through.
- Stays `wasm32`-checkable and GUI-free (consumers: Team compiler, Balls compiler, Export upgrader,
  Player aesthetics editor).
