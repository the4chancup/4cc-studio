# 4cc Studio — Model conversion plan: Model format conversion

Part of the [Model conversion plan](README.md). Section headings are unchanged from the single-file plan, so an existing pointer to a section still names it; only the file part of the pointer changed.

## Model Format Conversion

**Conversion is not offered as a standalone tool.** It is integrated into the Team compiler: exports
may contain models in any supported format (`.fmdl`, `.model`, `.gltf`), and the pipeline converts
them to the target PES version's format at compile time. The logic lives in the `model_convert` lib
crate.

### What the converters do

**FMDL → .model (19→16):**
1. Parse FMDL binary → FMDL object
2. Decode mesh splitting (reassemble sub-meshes)
3. Decode split vertex encoding (restore vertex order)
4. Decode anti-blur (strip duplicate meshes)
5. Remap bones through `missingBones` table (FMDL has more bones than .model) — in the Studio, the
   per-version retargeting pass (see "Skeleton retargeting and bone conformance")
6. Convert vertices/faces (reverse face winding, Vector4→Vector3 normals)
7. Convert materials (FMDL shader/technique → .model shader)
8. Encode mesh splitting for .model format
9. Encode split vertex encoding
10. Write .model binary

**.model → FMDL (16→21):**
1. Parse .model binary → Model object
2. Decode mesh splitting
3. Decode split vertex encoding
4. Build bone hierarchy (lookup in PesSkeletonData, set parent/children)
5. Convert vertices/faces (reverse winding, Vector3→Vector4 normals/tangents)
6. Create static bone for boneless meshes (fox PES requires bone assignment)
7. Convert materials (.model shader → FMDL shader/technique, assign textures, calculate alpha/shadow
   flags)
8. Calculate bone bounding boxes
9. Create mesh groups
10. Encode mesh splitting for FMDL format
11. Encode split vertex encoding
12. Encode anti-blur (generate duplicate meshes)
13. Write FMDL binary

### Performance-critical operation: mesh splitting

Mesh splitting is a graph partitioning algorithm that cuts meshes exceeding hardware limits (32
bones, 65535 vertices, 21845 faces) into sub-meshes. It involves:
- Building bone-to-vertex maps
- Greedy graph growing: iteratively grow sub-meshes by adding adjacent faces, checking bone count
  constraints
- Vertex deduplication across sub-mesh boundaries
- Face reordering

This is O(V×F) in the worst case — tight loops over vertex arrays with per-iteration set operations.
This is where Rust's performance is essential:

| Language | Estimated time per complex model |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Python | 1–5 seconds |
| Rust | 10–50 milliseconds |

### Skeleton data

`PesSkeletonData.py` (55KB) is hardcoded bone matrices, parent relationships, and positions for
*one* PES skeleton (its matrices equal PES17's `body.skl` transforms to 5e-16, measured). The Studio
replaces it with the games' own skeleton files, **one set per PES version**, embedded in the
binary (a few KB each) and exposed through one lookup:

```rust
pub struct PesBone {
    pub name: String,
    pub skl_parent: Option<String>,    // the SKL file's own parent_index, resolved to a name
    pub render_parent: Option<String>, // the mesh-splitting/Blender hierarchy (`render_parents.rs`)
    pub matrix: Affine,                // model-space 3×4 bind transform from the SKL
}

/// One skeleton file, bones sorted by name for lookup.
pub struct Skeleton { pub bones: Vec<PesBone> }
impl Skeleton { pub fn bone(&self, name: &str) -> Option<&PesBone>; }

pub struct VersionSkeletons {
    pub body: Skeleton,
    pub face: Skeleton,                // Fox versions ship face.skl; pre-Fox uses PES19's
    pub hand_l: Skeleton,              // likewise hand_l.skl / hand_r.skl
    pub hand_r: Skeleton,
    pub body_skl_bytes: &'static [u8], // the verbatim game file, for Fox template injection
}

pub fn skeletons(version: PesVersion) -> &'static VersionSkeletons;   // PES20 = PES21
```

The plan's first draft had `phf::Map`s of `&'static` data generated into a source file; a sorted
`Vec` with a binary search over at most 175 names is as fast as matters and needs neither a
generator nor a dependency. The Blender display positions (`start`/`end`, `PesSkeletonData`'s
`_displayPositions`) are not skeleton data the games ship; they join `PesBone` in Phase 7 with the
glTF exporter that needs them.

**Provenance.** Every number comes from a game file, never from a transcription. The files
themselves are checked in under `resources/skeletons/pes{15,16,17,18,19,21}/` (extracted once,
stored decompressed; see the README there), embedded with `include_bytes!` and parsed once at first
use with `fmdl::SklFile` — the Python literals are not copied. The one hand-maintained skeleton
table is `render_parents.rs`, names only: `PesSkeletonData`'s render hierarchy (140 bones, body,
hands and face), which no game file records. A bone outside that table is a render root, which is
what every `dsk_*` bone already is in the games' own parent columns. Where each version keeps its
player skeletons in the game data:

| Version | Archive | Path | Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| PES15 | `dt32.cpk` | `common/character1/model/character/body/body.skl` (WESYS-compressed) | body only |
| PES16 | `dt32_win.cpk` | same path | body only |
| PES17 | `dt32_win.cpk` | same path | body only |
| PES18 | `dt00_x64.cpk` | `Asset/model/character/#Win/common_package.fpk` → `/Assets/pes16/model/character/common/{body,face,hand_l,hand_r,boots}.skl` | body, face, hands, boots |
| PES19 | `dt00_x64.cpk` | same | same |
| PES21 | `dt00_x64.cpk` | same | same |

PES20 was never used in a 4cc event and is not installed; **PES20 is assumed to equal PES21** until
its files are checked. Pre-Fox ships no hand or face SKL (its remaining `.skl` files are cutscene
mobs/props and 2D overlays), which is why `.model` files carry only names and matrices and leave the
hierarchy to the table; the hand and face hierarchies for pre-Fox targets come from PES19's files,
as `PesSkeletonData.py` already did. The `render_parent` column is `PesSkeletonData`'s own (the SKL
files' `parent_index` makes almost every `dsk_*` bone a root, so it cannot serve as a hierarchy for
mesh splitting or Blender armatures).

**The body skeleton is not one skeleton.** Parsing all six `body.skl` files side by side:

| Version | Bones | Compared with PES21 |
|---|---|---|
| PES15 | 76 | 12 exclusive bones (`dsk_belly`, `dsk_chest`, `dsk_upperarm_{b,m,t}_{l,r}`, `tip_belly`, `tip_chest`; `dsk_thigh_{l,r}`, which return in PES19); **lacks** `dsk_deltoid_*`, `dsk_trapezius_*`, `dsk_upperarm_long_*`; 20 shared bones have a different rest pose — `dsk_scapula_r` (1.89 max component delta), `dsk_scapula_l`, `dsk_pectoralis_*` (0.52), `dsk_belly_scale`, and the **whole forearm/hand chain** (`sk_forearm_*`, `sk_hand_*`, `dsk_wrist_*`, `dsk_forearm*_*`, `dsk_elbow_*`, 0.18–0.50) |
| PES16 | 70 | identical bone set and transforms to PES17 |
| PES17 | 70 | `dsk_deltoid_*` rest pose differs (0.25) |
| PES18 | 76 | PES17 + `dsk_belly_{f,o,ba}_{l,r}` (as roots; PES21 hangs them under `dsk_pos_belly_*`) |
| PES19 | 116 | adds `dsk_pos_*` helpers, `dsk_hip/leg/pants/thigh_*`, `dsk_upperarm_skin_*`; **8 bones PES21 lacks**: `dsk_pos_{1,2,3}_wrist_*`, `dsk_pos_clavicle_*`, `dsk_pos_trapezius_*` |
| PES21 | 175 | adds sleeves, sternum, underarm, kneeback, thighmain, hem fakes, `pos_arm_target_*`; not a superset of PES19 |

Consequences: PES21 is the right *Fox injection template* (Red's practice; older Fox games tolerate
extra bones in an injected `.skl`), but it is the wrong source of **bind matrices for a `.model`**
and the wrong **bone-set reference** for any version but itself.

### Skeleton retargeting and bone conformance

A model authored against one version's skeleton and compiled for another has two distinct problems,
which the legacy tools conflated:

- **A. Bones the target lacks.** Their weights must be transferred to a bone the target has.
- **B. Bones the target has at a different rest pose.** The mesh is bound to the *source* pose:
  its inverse bind matrices (inline in a `.model`, in the glTF skin, in an FMDL's companion `.skl`
  or the template) describe where each bone was when the vertices were authored. If those matrices
  do not match the target game's runtime skeleton, vertices rotate about the wrong pivots — fine at
  rest, wrong in any pose that flexes the joint.

The `4cc-model-simplifier-15` (`Engines/python/simplify.py`) and the 19to16 converter are the
prototypes. Both solve A with a hand-written table (`missingBones`: `dsk_deltoid_*` →
`dsk_upperarm_*`, `dsk_trapezius_*` → `sk_shoulder_*`, `dsk_upperarm_long_*` → `dsk_upperarm_*`).
Neither solves B: both write **PES17's** matrices (`PesSkeletonData`) into models destined for other
versions, and the simplifier's "full" mode papers over the worst B cases by transferring weights
away from the displaced bones (`movedBones`: `dsk_belly_scale` → `sk_belly`, `dsk_pectoralis_*` →
`sk_chest`, `dsk_scapula_r` → `sk_shoulder_r`) — losing the deformation those bones provide. The
forearm/hand chain, displaced just as much in PES15, was never handled, which is the probable cause
of the **broken wrist pose in some PES15 animations (the pre-match entrance) on 17→15 ports** — a
pose-dependent error is exactly what wrong bind pivots produce. *Hypothesis; verify on a known-broken
port once the pass exists.*

The Studio runs one IR pass, `retarget(ir: &mut CanonicalModel, target: PesVersion) ->
Result<Vec<loss::Finding>, ConvertError>` (`skeletons/retarget.rs`; the error is a singular bind
matrix, which no importer lets through), in every export path after conversion and before mesh
splitting. A bone is *standard* when some version's tables (any body, face or hand skeleton) name
it, *custom* otherwise; only standard bones the target lacks are folded, and custom bones pass
through untouched, matrices included. The source bind pose is already in the IR's
`Bone.matrix` (the importers put it there); the pass rewrites the bones and vertices in place:

1. **Source bind pose.** `.model`: the inline matrices, inverted. glTF: `skin.inverseBindMatrices`.
   FMDL: the companion `.skl`; without one, the source is assumed to be **PES21**'s skeleton (the
   only Fox versions in 4cc use are 18/19/21 and their shared bones differ by ≤0.25 on `dsk_deltoid`
   and the toe tips; FMDL files do not record their game version).
2. **Fold bones the target lacks** (problem A). For each used bone absent from the target's body
   table, transfer its weight to the bone named by the **fold table** for that bone — one table for
   every version, name → name, in `skeletons/fold.rs`: the two legacy tables verbatim, the
   PES15-only bones (`dsk_chest` → `sk_chest`, `dsk_belly` → `sk_belly`, `dsk_upperarm_{b,m,t}_*` →
   `dsk_upperarm_*`, `tip_belly`/`tip_chest` → `sk_belly`/`sk_chest`), PES19's `dsk_pos_*` helpers
   (`dsk_pos_*_wrist_*` → `sk_hand_*`, `dsk_pos_<bone>_*` → `dsk_<bone>_*` or the `sk_` bone
   the helper sits on), and PES21's additions whose name spells the body part (`dsk_sleeve*`,
   `dsk_underarm*` → `sk_upperarm_*`; `dsk_hem_*_fake_*` → `dsk_hem_*_*`; `dsk_kneeback_*` →
   `sk_leg_*`; `dsk_thighmain_*` → `sk_thigh_*`; `dsk_sternum_*` → `sk_chest`). Entries beyond the
   legacy tables are name-based judgment, not game-verified. A table entry whose target the version
   also lacks is **followed as a chain** (`dsk_upperarm_long_l` → `dsk_upperarm_l` → PES15 has it;
   `dsk_pos_trapezius_l` → `dsk_trapezius_l` → `sk_shoulder_l` on PES15); a unit test walks every
   entry against every version and fails on a chain that ends nowhere or loops. A removed bone with
   no entry (PES21's `dsk_back`, the `pos_arm_target_*` IK helpers) falls back to the **nearest
   target body bone by rest position** (the model's own bind translation against the target
   table's). Every fold of a weighted bone is reported, one finding per bone with `detail`
   `"<bone> -> <target>"`: `bone_folded_for_version` from the table, `bone_folded_by_position`
   for the fallback (a guess the user should hear about); an unweighted removed bone just
   disappears. Bone groups and vertex mappings are remapped exactly as the simplifier's
   `simplifyModel` does: the folded bone leaves the bone list and every group, the target bone is
   appended where absent (to the model with the target's matrix, to the group), and a vertex whose
   slots now name one bone twice merges the weights into the first slot. Children of a removed bone
   take its parent. The SKL parent chain is *not* used: almost every `dsk_*` bone is a root in the
   games' own files.
3. **Re-bind to the target pose** (problem B). For every surviving bone, re-pose the vertices from
   the source rest pose into the target's — `v' = Σᵢ wᵢ · B_target,ᵢ · B_source,ᵢ⁻¹ · v` over the
   vertex's weights, normals/tangents by the rotational part — and write the **target version's**
   inverse bind matrices into the emitted `.model` bone table or generated `.skl`. Weights are
   untouched: `dsk_scapula_r` keeps driving the shoulder blade, sitting where PES15 expects it.
   Reported once per model as `skeleton_retargeted` (I, `detail` the moved-bone count) when any
   bone's delta `Dᵢ` differs from the identity by more than a tolerance (1e-3 on any component);
   a bone within tolerance is left exactly as it was, and a vertex none of whose bones moved is
   not touched, so a same-version compile is a no-op by construction, float noise included.
   Normals, tangents (xyz; `w` kept) and bitangents take the blended rotation and are
   renormalized. Bones the target's tables do not know at all (a genuine custom skeleton) keep
   the model's own matrices, as before.
4. **Hands and face** conform the same way against the target's `hand_*`/`face` tables where it
   ships them (Fox) and PES19's otherwise.

The two legacy tables become regression fixtures: PES19→PES16 and PES17→PES15 must fold exactly the
`missingBones` those tools folded, and must *not* fold the `movedBones` (retargeting handles them).
Retargeting is also what makes the **PES19→PES21** compile correct — today Red leaves PES19's eight
`dsk_pos_*` bones dangling in a PES21 FMDL; whether the game ignores or misrenders them is untested,
and folding makes it moot. A manual per-folder override for fold targets is deliberately not
specified: the table plus nearest-bone fallback should cover real exports, and `settings.toml` is
kept to savefile settings; revisit if a case turns up.

**Cost.** Re-binding is linear-blend skinning evaluated once, offline. Per surviving bone one delta
matrix `Dᵢ = B_target,ᵢ · B_source,ᵢ⁻¹` is precomputed (≤ 175 small matrix products); per vertex the
position is `Σ wᵢ Dᵢ v` over at most four weights (≈ 50 multiply-adds) and the normal/tangent take
the rotational part (≈ 40 more) — on the order of 100 flops per vertex, done in place. A 20k-vertex
player model is ~2 M flops, well under a millisecond single-threaded; the largest 4cc models
(~100k vertices) stay in single-digit milliseconds. It is not measurable next to mesh splitting
(10–50 ms per model) or texture encoding (hundreds of ms), and it runs at all only when a
native-format pre-check (bone names and the two versions' tables, no geometry read) finds a used
bone that the target lacks or poses differently beyond tolerance — same-version compiles, and
cross-version compiles of models that only use unchanged bones, never enter the pass. What it does
add for a **same-format** cross-version compile (a PES21-authored FMDL for PES18) is the IR
round-trip it needs to run at all, which is why it is listed with hand auto-split as an explicit
exception to the "same format skips the IR" rule; that round-trip
is the lossless one the plan already tests, and it costs a few milliseconds of parse/serialize.

### SKL binary format

Fox-engine `.skl` files carry the bone list and bind-pose transforms for a corresponding `.fmdl`.
Most models use the compiler's template skeletons (`body.skl` → `boots.skl` / `fcl_hair_sim.skl`);
custom `.skl` files are rare and only needed for models with a custom pose. The binary format is
simple (reference parser: `examples/skl.py`):

```
Header (12 bytes — 3 u32s):
  u32 magic       = 12        (version/identifier)
  u32 bone_count  = N
  u32 record_size = 56

Bone records (N × 56 bytes, starting at offset 12):
  u32 name_offset     — byte offset into the file for this bone's null-terminated name
  i32 parent_index    — -1 for root, else 0-based index into the bone array
  f32[12] transform   — 3×4 row-major [rotation_3x3 | translation_3x1]

Name table (at offset 12 + N×56):
  concatenated null-terminated ASCII strings, padded to 4-byte alignment
```

Each transform row is `[rot_x, rot_y, rot_z, translation]`, giving a 3×3 bind-pose rotation plus a
model-space position per bone. The positions correspond to the `PesSkeletonData._positions`
reference, but template variants can differ numerically; do not require exact equality to that
hardcoded reference. Preserve the SKL parent hierarchy separately from the render hierarchy. The `fmdl` crate owns the SKL codec alongside
the FMDL codec (same format family — both are Fox-engine binary formats consumed together at pack
time).

### SKL and glTF: native integration, not a companion

A glTF-authored model stores its skeleton natively in the glTF `skin` (field mapping in the format
plan, "Skeleton: native glTF skin, not a companion SKL"). When the target is Fox, `ir_to_fmdl`'s
caller reconstructs the `.skl` binary from the IR bones — which `gltf_to_ir` filled from the skin's
joint hierarchy and bind data, applying the inverse coordinate/local-to-model-space mapping.

For Fox-native `.fmdl` inputs staying native, the companion `.skl` can travel as opaque
pass-through bytes. Native→IR conversion and Blender import also decode it for skeleton
reconstruction; the SKL codec is not limited to glTF-authored inputs. The [Aesthetics export plan's "SKL pairing"
section](../aesthetics_export/README.md) describes how paired SKLs travel with their models through links and
merges regardless of source format.

### GPU offloading

**Not worth it.** The workload doesn't match GPU strengths:
- Mesh splitting: branch-heavy, irregular memory access, set operations — GPUs perform poorly
- Vertex conversion: 5K-20K vertices is too small to justify GPU dispatch overhead (~100μs)
- Matrix inversion: ~100 tiny 3×4 matrices — CPU does this in microseconds

Keep model geometry conversion on the CPU and benchmark the port rather than promising specific
latencies. Texture encoding is a separate workload: the [library crates plan](../libs/README.md) includes
first-release desktop GPU BC7 for PNG-heavy PES 19–21 builds, with CPU fallback. That texture-only
exception does not change this plan's CPU geometry processing or deterministic model output.
