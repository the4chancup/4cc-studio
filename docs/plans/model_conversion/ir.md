# 4cc Studio — Model conversion plan: Intermediate representation

Part of the [Model conversion plan](README.md). Section headings are unchanged from the single-file plan, so an existing pointer to a section still names it; only the file part of the pointer changed.

## Intermediate Representation (IR)

### Purpose

The IR is a canonical PES model representation that is a **superset** of both FMDL and .model
formats. It eliminates duplicated conversion logic by providing one decode path and one encode path
per format, instead of N×N direct converters.

### When the IR is used

- **Same format as target**: ordinary processing skips the IR; hand auto-split, pre-Fox
  `ingame_face` merging, and skeleton retargeting across PES versions (only when a native-format
  pre-check finds a used bone the target lacks or poses differently — see "Skeleton retargeting and
  bone conformance") are the explicit IR-operation exceptions described in `conversion.md`.
- **FMDL → .model**: FMDL → IR → .model
- **.model → FMDL**: .model → IR → FMDL
- **glTF → FMDL**: glTF → IR → FMDL
- **glTF → .model**: glTF → IR → .model
- **FMDL / .model → glTF**: native → IR → glTF (`ir_to_gltf` — the [Player aesthetics
  editor](../player_aesthetics_editor.md)'s conversion; the Team compiler never emits glTF)

### IR struct

The IR uses `Option<T>` for format-specific fields. `Some` when imported from the format that has
the field, `None` when imported from a format that doesn't. Exporters fill in defaults for missing
fields.

```rust
pub struct CanonicalModel {
    pub bones: Vec<Bone>,
    pub meshes: Vec<Mesh>,
    pub mesh_groups: Vec<MeshGroup>,
    pub materials: Vec<Material>,
    pub textures: Vec<Texture>,
    pub extension_headers: BTreeSet<String>,   // model-level header lines neither format crate
                                               //   types (`Skeleton-Type: Simplified`, ...)
    pub source_format: SourceFormat,           // Fox | PreFox (Gltf joins in Phase 7)
}

pub struct Bone {
    pub name: String,
    pub parent: Option<usize>,       // hierarchy: FMDL stores it; .model does not (resolved by
                                     //   name from the template skeleton's render parents)
    pub matrix: Affine,              // model-space 3×4 bind transform. Sources: FMDL's companion
                                     //   .skl (or the template); .model's inline per-bone inverse
                                     //   bind matrix, inverted; glTF skin bind data
    // FMDL-specific. In a self-consistent Konami FMDL + SKL pair (the audience fixture)
    // `global_position` is the SKL translation and `local_position` is `global` minus the
    // parent's `global` (roots: equal to `global`), so an exporter without them derives both
    // from `matrix` and `parent`; the player-part templates carry placeholder values instead.
    pub global_position: Option<[f32; 4]>,
    pub local_position: Option<[f32; 4]>,
    pub bounding_box: Option<BoundingBox>,
}

pub struct Mesh {
    pub vertices: Vertices,
    pub faces: Vec<[u16; 3]>,        // one winding for the whole IR (FMDL's); `.model` reverses
    pub bone_group: Vec<usize>,      // indices into `bones`; `vertices.bone_indices` index this
    pub material: usize,
    pub extension_headers: BTreeSet<String>,   // per-mesh header lines the format crate leaves raw
    pub custom_bounding_box: Option<BoundingBox>,  // FMDL `Custom-Bounding-Box-Meshes`
}

// Struct-of-arrays, like both format crates' `MeshVertices`: a conversion is a column copy,
// and no per-vertex allocation exists on a 100k-vertex model. Every `Vec` is `positions.len()`
// long when present.
pub struct Vertices {
    pub positions: Vec<[f32; 3]>,
    pub normals: Option<Vec<[f32; 4]>>,      // w is 1.0 in every Konami FMDL measured; a
                                             //   `.model` import sets 1.0, an export drops it
    pub tangents: Option<Vec<[f32; 4]>>,     // w is the handedness (+-1 in Konami files)
    pub bitangents: Option<Vec<[f32; 3]>>,   // `.model` only; an FMDL export drops them (loss)
    pub colors: Option<Vec<[u8; 4]>>,
    pub uvs: Vec<Vec<[f32; 2]>>,
    pub uv_high_precision: Vec<bool>,        // parallel to `uvs`; FMDL only, false elsewhere
    pub bone_indices: Option<Vec<[u8; 4]>>,  // into `Mesh::bone_group`; unused slots 0
    pub bone_weights: Option<Vec<[f32; 4]>>, // floats; FMDL's bytes are `/255` on import and
                                             //   re-quantized on export so the total is kept
    pub bone_weight_width: Option<u8>,       // `.model` stores 2, 3 or 4 weights; `None` = 4
}

pub struct MeshGroup {
    pub name: String,                // `.model` has no groups: import makes one per mesh named
    pub parent: Option<usize>,       //   after the mesh, export names the mesh after its group
    pub meshes: Vec<usize>,
    pub visible: bool,
}

pub struct Texture {
    pub directory: String,           // verbatim from the source (`/Assets/.../sourceimages/`,
    pub file_name: String,           //   `./`); extension kept as found. Final in-game paths are
}                                    //   the Team compiler's texture relocation step, not this crate's

pub struct BoundingBox { pub min: [f32; 4], pub max: [f32; 4] }
```

Shapes this settled after reading the format crates (each is a decision entry): vertices are a
struct of arrays, not a `Vec<Vertex>`; `Bone.children` is gone (derivable, and a second copy to
keep in step through folds and prunes); `Mesh` carries no `alpha_flags`/`shadow_flags`/anti-blur
fields (lifted to the material's `fox` table, see "Engine mapping") and no `split_group_id` (the
importers call the format crates' split *decode*, so an imported mesh is whole; a glTF `PES_mesh`
identity is Phase 7's); `extension_headers` are sets of raw header lines, since both format
crates already type the known headers; the template display positions (`start`/`end`) wait for the
Blender export in Phase 7. `Affine` is the crate's own 3×4 row-major matrix type (`affine.rs`:
multiply, invert, transform point/direction), because the only matrix work in the suite is bone
transforms and a dependency on `nalgebra` would add a generic API for four functions.

**What a `.model` import drops** (reported through `loss.rs`, never silently): Konami's lower LOD
face lists (no 4cc export carries any; the add-on writes none), Konami's `(kind, text)` tags, the
editor-data items and the geometry order word. Everything the community add-on writes survives.

The material side of the IR (`materials/mod.rs`, re-exported by `ir`):

```rust
// Mirrors the materials.toml schema (see the Unified model format plan): an
// engine-neutral core plus one optional table per engine. `Some` when imported
// from that engine's format or from a toml that fills it; exporters derive a
// missing engine table from `family` via the shader-family defaults.
pub struct Material {
    pub name: String,
    pub family: MaterialFamily,                  // Shaded | Shadeless | Metal | Glass
    pub two_sided: Option<bool>,
    pub transparent: Option<bool>,
    pub antiblur: Option<bool>,
    pub textures: Vec<(TextureRole, usize)>,     // canonical role → index into `textures`
    pub parameters: Vec<(String, [f32; 4])>,     // engine-neutral shader parameters
    pub fox: Option<FoxMaterial>,
    pub prefox: Option<PreFoxMaterial>,
}

pub struct FoxMaterial {
    pub shader: String,
    pub technique: String,
    pub alpha_flags: u8,                         // per-mesh in FMDL; see the format plan's flag rule
    pub shadow_flags: u8,

    pub invisible: Option<bool>,

    pub textures: Vec<(String, usize)>,          // native sampler name → texture, non-canonical only
    pub parameters: Vec<(String, [f32; 4])>,
}

pub struct PreFoxMaterial {
    pub shader: String,
    pub states: Vec<(String, u32)>,              // ztest, zwrite, twosided, alphatest, alpharef, alphablend, blendmode
    pub samplers: Vec<(String, SamplerSettings)>, // native sampler name → srgb/filters/addressing/maxaniso
    pub textures: Vec<(String, usize)>,          // native sampler name → texture, non-canonical only
                                                 //   (`RoughnessMap` on 312 Konami materials, `Normal2`, ...)
    pub parameters: Vec<(String, Vec<f32>)>,     // .mtl <vector> elements, one to four components as stored
}

// The `.mtl` sampler attributes minus name and path (which live in `Texture`); the same
// closed sets `pes_model::format::mtl` reads, redeclared here because `materials/` imports no
// format crate.
pub struct SamplerSettings {
    pub srgb: Option<bool>,
    pub minfilter: Option<Filter>, pub magfilter: Option<Filter>, pub mipfilter: Option<Filter>,
    pub uaddr: Option<Address>, pub vaddr: Option<Address>, pub waddr: Option<Address>,
    pub maxaniso: Option<u32>,
}
pub enum Filter { Linear, Point, Anisotropic }
pub enum Address { Wrap, Clamp, Repeat }
```

(`states` are `u32` and `parameters` keep their stored component count, as the `.mtl` codec
reads them, so a `.model` round trip loses nothing; the plan's draft had `i32` and `[f32; 4]`.)

FMDL stores four-component normals and tangents; the IR must not silently discard their fourth
components. glTF uses three-component normals and four-component tangents (including handedness),
so conversion must distinguish semantic tangent handedness from native metadata and preserve
otherwise unrepresented native components through the PES metadata path. Roundtrip fixtures cover
non-default fourth components, not only ordinary XYZ data.

**Deterministic collections.** Order-bearing IR metadata uses `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet` (or equivalently
sorted vectors), never serialization by `HashMap`/`HashSet` iteration. Importers normalize extension
keys, and exporters/merge routines emit them in canonical order. This is required by the Team
compiler's byte-reproducible Rust-output contract.

### Material sources per format

The three formats keep material data (shader, texture paths, render states) in
different places; the IR's `Material` is the merge point:

- **FMDL** embeds materials in the model binary — `fmdl_to_ir` reads them from
  the file itself. FMDL texture path tables store **stems** (no extension) — the
  game appends `.ftex` at load time — so FMDL has always been extension-agnostic.
- **.model** keeps them in the sibling **`.mtl` XML**, with meshes binding
  materials by name. A pre-Fox native source is therefore an atomic bundle
  (`.model` + `.mtl`): `model_to_ir` consumes both and `ir_to_model` emits both.
  Conversion never changes one without the other. The `.mtl` codec lives in
  `pes_model` alongside the `.model` codec (it's the same format family; the
  Team compiler's MTL validation and path rewriting use the same parser).
- **glTF** keeps them in **TOML files** alongside the glTF, mirroring the
  `.model`/`.mtl` split: the glTF's `primitive.material` references name
  materials, and the PES-specific properties live in `materials.toml` /
  `*.materials.toml` files in the same folder (never embedded in the glTF
  JSON). The file pattern, name matching, layering, `.common` link files, and
  the complete schema are in the [Unified model format plan](../model_format.md).
  `gltf_to_ir` takes the folder's resolved material files as an argument and
  fills the IR's `Material` structs from them; the glTF files themselves are
  never rewritten (exports stay read-only). glTF-only — FMDL and .model keep
  their native mechanisms.

**Engine mapping.** The IR `Material` is engine-neutral in its core (`family`,
booleans, canonical texture roles, parameters) with an optional native table per
engine. Importers fill the native table of their own engine verbatim and infer
`family` from the shader; exporters use the target engine's native table when
present and otherwise derive it from `family` through the shader-family defaults
and role→sampler tables in the format plan. So a `.model` → IR → FMDL conversion
picks the Fox shader from the family (as `model2fmdl.py` does today with its
`Basic_C` → `fox3ddf_blin` table), while an FMDL → IR → FMDL round-trip never
touches the shader at all. Per-mesh FMDL flags are lifted to the material on
import (splitting instances whose meshes differ) and pushed back down on export.

What the native importers derive for the *other* engine: `fmdl_to_ir` sets `two_sided` from alpha
bit 32 and leaves `transparent` unset. It does not read bit 128 as transparency: a census of 1983
Konami FMDLs found bit 128 on 128/160 of `fox3ddf_blin`'s meshes in near-equal share with 32/0,
i.e. on ordinary opaque skin, and the legacy converter judged transparency from the texture's alpha
channel instead, which the format plan rules out. So a Fox part converted to pre-Fox gets the opaque
state set unless its family is `glass`; what bit 128 means on deferred shaders is an open question.
`model_to_ir` sets `two_sided` from the `twosided` state and `transparent` from `alphablend`.
`ir_to_fmdl` adds the game's `dummy_nrm`/`dummy_srm` textures (`/Assets/pes16/model/character/
common/sourceimages/`, the same dummies the anti-blur materials use) to a `shaded`/`metal` material
missing its normal or specular map, as the working 16→21 converter does; the compiler's texture
step replaces them when the folder has real maps. Only a material without a `fox` table gets them:
a Fox-native material that ships without the maps (Konami's audience parts) is left as the game
shipped it, so a same-format round trip adds no textures. Bone positions an FMDL export lacks are derived
from `Bone.matrix` (see the `Bone` comment); the root's `local_position` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, a guess
consistent with the audience fixture's `sk_belly` and unverified in game (the working converter
wrote zero for every bone, so the game appears not to read the field when the template `.skl` is
injected).

What the `.model` pair carries that the IR does not, and how the pre-Fox importer and exporter
treat it:

- **Bone order.** IR bones are parent-first (a one-pass invariant every consumer relies on, and
  the order the SKL and FMDL files use). A `.model` lists bones in Konami's order, which is not
  always parent-first under the render hierarchy: 44 of 2606 Konami files list `dsk_forearm_l`
  before its render parent `dsk_forearm_t_l`. `model_to_ir` therefore places a bone right after
  its parent when the file lists it earlier (everything else keeps file order) and remaps the bone
  groups; vertex indices are untouched. A bone's `parent` is its render parent when that bone is
  in the model, else `None`, as the legacy converters did (no climbing to a present ancestor: in
  914 files `skf_brow_*` hangs under the absent `skf_glabella`, and the legacy made them roots).
- **Stored matrices** are the row-major 3x4 inverse bind, the `Affine` layout: on the fixtures
  the inverse of the stored matrix equals PES17 `body.skl`'s bind pose within 1.3e-5 (7.2e-5 on
  the add-on-written card head). A singular stored matrix is an error, not a finding.
- **Normals and tangents** are three components; the import widens with `w = 1.0` on both, as
  the working 16→21 converter does. Whether the tangent `w` should instead be the handedness
  read off the `.model`'s bitangent is an open question for converge (the converter's output is
  accepted in game as is). Bitangents are carried in the IR and written back verbatim; a Fox
  source has none and the export writes none, as the 19→16 converter did.
- **Faces** reverse winding on import and again on export (the IR keeps FMDL's).
- **Lower LOD levels, Konami tags, editor data, a nonzero mesh `order`, nonzero model
  `flags`**: not in the IR (no 4cc export carries them). Each non-default one the import drops
  is a `native_field_dropped` finding whose `detail` names the field; the export writes no
  LODs (`LodRecord::for_levels(0)`), no tags, `order` 0, `flags` 0, and recomputes the mesh and
  model bounds from the positions.
- **Mesh names.** `.model` has no groups; the import makes one group per mesh named after the
  add-on's mesh name, `mesh_<index>` when the mesh has none (every Konami mesh), and the export
  names each mesh after the group that lists it (an add-on kind-128 annotation), `None` when no
  group does. So a Konami `.model` round trip gains `mesh_<index>` names; the game ignores them.
- **Per-mesh extension headers** carry over minus the codec markers (`Split-Mesh` is consumed
  by the split decode, the vertex-loop marker by the export's re-encode).
- **The `.mtl`.** Each material name the model binds must have a definition, else an error; a
  definition no mesh binds (Konami's `accessory.mtl` defines many parts' materials in one file)
  is not carried, so the exported `.mtl` holds exactly the model's materials, in model order.
  Sampler paths split at the last `/` into `Texture`; entries are written samplers first, then
  states, then vectors: Konami's own order in 1217 of the 1265 materials that mix samplers and
  states (census over 941 PES 2017 `.mtl`, 3102 materials; 14 put states first, `glasses_02T`
  among them), so a round trip of those 14 regroups entries and changes nothing else.
- **Indices without weights.** A `.model` mesh may store bone indices and no weights (Konami's
  cards and glasses: slot 0 binds the vertex fully). The IR keeps one representation, indices
  and weights together, so the import synthesizes `[1, 0, 0, 0]` per vertex and the export writes
  the weights out (`QuadFloat32`): the same binding in the other of the format's two spellings,
  not a loss, so no finding.
- **`transparent` and the stored states.** `model_to_ir` reads `transparent` off `alphablend`
  alone, so on export the boolean owns `alphablend` alone when a `prefox` table is present (as
  `two_sided` owns `twosided`); the `zwrite`/`alphatest`/`alphablend` triple is set as a whole
  only when the states come from the family default set. Otherwise a stored `alphatest: 1,
  alphablend: 1` (the add-on's card heads) would come back as `alphatest: 0`, rewritten by the
  very boolean read from it.

**Stem-based texture references (input).** All three formats reference textures
by **stem** (filename without extension) in their **source/authoring** form; the
compiler resolves each stem to whatever accepted image file exists in the model
folder and converts to the target format at compile time (format list, stem
conflicts, and auto-naming rules: format plan, "Dependencies and images" and
"Textures"). Studio-format `.mtl` and `.materials.toml` files write stems; FMDL
path tables were already stem-based. The Export upgrader strips extensions from
old `.mtl` texture paths when migrating. **Output** `.mtl` files (written by
`ir_to_model` at compile time) keep the `.dds` extension on texture paths, as
the game expects; FMDL output path tables remain stem-based (the game appends
`.ftex`). Auto-naming and auto-detection of texture roles happen during deep
material parsing (not the structure pass), so a missing texture reports
`mtl_texture_not_found` / `material_texture_not_found` at that stage, not during
shallow validation.

### Extension algorithms (one implementation each)

Each format extension (mesh splitting, anti-blur, split vertex encoding) lives in the format crate
that owns it, not in `model_convert`. The IR importers/exporters call the format crate's
decode/encode functions. This keeps same-format round-trips (e.g. FMDL→Blender→FMDL via the PyO3
bindings) lossless and IR-free, while cross-format conversions still benefit from a single
implementation:

| Algorithm | Owner crate | Called by (decode) | Called by (encode) |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| FMDL mesh splitting | `fmdl` | `fmdl_to_ir` | `ir_to_fmdl` |
| .model mesh splitting | `pes_model` | `model_to_ir` | `ir_to_model` |
| FMDL anti-blur | `fmdl` | `fmdl_to_ir` | `ir_to_fmdl` |
| Split vertex encoding (FMDL) | `fmdl` | `fmdl_to_ir` | `ir_to_fmdl` |
| Split vertex encoding (.model) | `pes_model` | `model_to_ir` | `ir_to_model` |

A bug fix in FMDL mesh splitting decode benefits every path starting from FMDL, regardless of target
format — and also benefits the Blender addon's direct FMDL round-trip, which calls the same `fmdl`
function without going through the IR at all.

The split vertex encoding is a property of the vertex *order* (loops of one vertex are consecutive
runs), and the IR keeps the vertex order, so its "decode" on import is a read the importers have
nothing to call: the owner map is recoverable from the IR at any time. The exporters recover it
with the format crate's per-mesh `vertex_enc::decode` on the IR order, *not* the flag-gated
`decode_model`: the IR carries no extension flag, and a run that satisfies the convention is a set
of loops of one vertex whether or not the file declared the extension (an add-on file's loops
survive the round trip; on a Konami file the same rule merges only vertices that share position,
weights and an increasing attribute order, which is what a loop is). The encode on export is not
a no-op: it groups every vertex sharing a topological key contiguously, and Konami files are not
written that way (highneck: 198 of 204 vertices move; the vertex multiset and the face corner-tuples
are unchanged). The legacy converters reorder the same way. A same-format round trip is therefore
compared against the input with the same encoders applied, never byte for byte (see "Testing: IR
roundtrips").

`fmdl` also owns **multi-FMDL mesh merging** — bone lists unioned by name (per-mesh bone groups
remapped), meshes and mesh groups concatenated, materials merged by name (same-name materials with
differing definitions rejected), buffers and headers rebuilt. It is not an IR operation: the Team
compiler calls it directly to assemble multi-part models and to bake Common-linked models into
player FMDLs on Fox targets, where the engine cannot load models from the Common folder (see "Common
model links and model merging" in the [Team compiler plan](../team_compiler/README.md)). The pre-Fox
counterpart is `pes_model::ops::merge`, native over `Model` + `MaterialSet` (see
"`pes_model::ops::merge`" in the [Libraries plan](../libs/format_crates.md)), which follows the same rules.

### Conversion routing

```rust
/// A model in one of the native formats, at the semantic layer of its format crate.
pub enum NativeModelBundle {
    Fox { model: fmdl::Model, skl: Option<fmdl::SklFile> },
    PreFox { model: pes_model::model::Model, mtl: pes_model::format::mtl::MaterialSet },
    // Gltf(GltfModel) joins in Phase 7
}

/// The bundle in `target`'s format (`target.engine()`), on `target`'s skeleton: the input
/// itself when it already is both, otherwise source → IR → `retarget` → target.
/// `Converted::findings` lists what the target could not keep (`loss.rs`), so the caller
/// reports rather than the user discovers.
pub fn convert(bundle: NativeModelBundle, target: PesVersion) -> Result<Converted, ConvertError>;

/// Whether `convert` would go through the IR: another engine, or a bone the bundle's groups
/// use that `target` lacks or poses differently (bone tables only, no geometry read).
pub fn needs_conversion(bundle: &NativeModelBundle, target: PesVersion) -> bool;

pub struct Converted { pub bundle: NativeModelBundle, pub findings: Vec<loss::Finding> }
```

`convert` takes a PES *version*, not a format: the format follows from the engine, and the
skeleton retargeting pass (see `conversion.md` "Skeleton retargeting and bone conformance") runs inside the same
IR round trip, so every model the compiler emits is on the target's skeleton without a second
pass. The same-format short cut is decided by `needs_conversion`, the plan's native pre-check: the
bundle's bone names (those its bone groups reference) against the target's tables, poses compared
the way `retarget` does (source pose from the SKL or PES21's tables for Fox, the inverted inline
matrix for pre-Fox; 1e-3 on any component). `convert` takes the bundle by value and returns a new
one, so a pre-Fox result exists only once both its `.model` and its `.mtl` were produced: an error
can never leave a converted `.model` paired with an old or missing `.mtl`. (The plan's first draft
mutated a bundle in place; by value says the same thing with the type system instead of a
comment.) The Fox side carries the companion `.skl` when one exists, which is where `fmdl_to_ir`
reads the bind pose from (see "Skeleton reconstruction from FMDL"); `ir_to_fmdl` returns one only
when a bone the target's tables do not know survives.

**Unskinned meshes on Fox.** FMDL needs every vertex bound to a bone: an unbound mesh stays where
the model is placed instead of following the player. A pre-Fox mesh without bone indices (the
ancient templates the 16→21 converter met) therefore gets, on `ir_to_fmdl`, a bone named `static`
(identity matrix, `global_position` `[0.2, 0, 0, 1]`, `local_position` zero: the converter's
values, the name Konami's own skeleton lacks so the game leaves the mesh static) added once to the
model, with every such mesh's vertices fully weighted to it (`static_bone_added`, one finding per
mesh). The bone is not in any table, so the export also emits an SKL; whether the compiler injects
that SKL or the template is Phase 4's call (open question there).

### Roundtrip testing

The IR enables lossless roundtrip tests for same-format paths (see `testing.md` "Testing: IR roundtrips").
Cross-format roundtrips (FMDL→.model→FMDL) are lossy in known, accepted ways (anti-blur regenerated,
mesh splits may differ). The IR preserves the metadata so the losses are explicit, not accidental.

### Data loss behavior

The existing direct converters are already lossy:
- FMDL→.model: anti-blur stripped (.model doesn't support it)
- .model→FMDL: anti-blur regenerated with defaults
- Both: bone names remapped through `missingBones` table
- Both: mesh splitting undone and redone
- FMDL→.model: custom bone transforms replaced by the template skeleton's (the converter never
  read the companion `.skl`)

Routing through the IR doesn't add new data loss, and removes the last one: bind transforms travel
in `Bone.matrix` from the `.skl` or the `.model`'s inline bone table to whichever format is written
(see "Skeleton in `.model`"). The other losses happen at different pipeline points. The IR
preserves metadata (e.g., `antiblur_source`), so if exporting back to FMDL, the metadata is
available.
