"""`just mutants <crate>`: a whole-crate cargo-mutants run, optionally split in two.

With `STUDIO_MUTANTS_REMOTE` set to an ssh host (e.g. `bonfire`) the run is
split with it: a whole-crate run hands each half a complementary set of the
crate's source files, sized by the two halves' measured per-mutant costs
(`target/mutants-cost.json`), through `examine_globs` in the local config and
`exclude_globs` in the remote's; a diff run, a crate with no measurement on a
side, and a file split that fails its exactness check keep the even
`--shard 0/2` / `1/2` round-robin. The remote half's results merge into
`mutants.out/remote/`. Unset (in the process
and, on Windows, in the user's registry environment) or empty, the plain local
command runs; it also runs for a crate in `LOCAL_ONLY_CRATES`, whose builds
outgrow the remote's memory cap.

The remote half runs as a transient systemd service on the host (`sudo -n
systemd-run --unit=studio-mutants`), detached from the ssh session by
construction, memory-capped and CPU-idle: the host also runs the production
Fluxer instance, an allocating mutant filled its RAM and swap at 2.20i, and
`nice` alone cannot keep the run off Fluxer's CPU (cgroup v2 weights ignore
it). Its state lives in `~/studio-mutants/run/` (`job.sh`, `in.diff`, `pid`,
`memory_max`, `log`, `exit`, `memory_peak`, `collected`), and this machine only
polls it with short ssh calls, so a dropped connection costs one poll, not the run:
cargo-mutants cannot resume, and a remote half tied to one long ssh session
died with it (2.20i). If this script itself stops, `just mutants-collect`
waits for the remote half and fetches it. A new run refuses to start while a
remote half is running or finished but not yet collected, since the collection
summarizes the local `mutants.out` with it, and a run that uses the remote also
while `just gates-remote` runs there. A
running half is stopped by hand with `sudo systemctl stop studio-mutants` on
the host.

The remote needs: git, a C toolchain, rustup, cargo-mutants and `just` (for
`just gates-remote`) at the local versions (the pinned toolchain installs itself
on first use inside the tree), `sudo -n systemd-run` for the ssh user, `ionice`,
`tar`, `nproc`, `awk`, cgroup v2 (the unit's `memory.peak`) and `python3` (`just gates`'
scripts).
