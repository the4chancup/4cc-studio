# build in their own copy of the tree under ~/studio-mutants/tmp. Nothing else is touched.
# Runs on the host: `ssh <host> "bash -s" < scripts/remote_clean_target.sh` for a dry run,
# `ssh <host> "bash -s -- --delete" < scripts/remote_clean_target.sh` to remove. Refuses
# while a remote half, the gates or any cargo process runs.
