"""Compares two census runs' outcomes path by path (outcomes_<a>.tsv, outcomes_<b>.tsv): how many
inputs kept their outcome, every change of outcome grouped by (before -> after) with up to five
paths each, and the inputs only one run holds. With reports_<tag>.txt, it also prints the lines a
changed input lost and gained. Both runs' files are under `config.CENSUS_DIR`.
