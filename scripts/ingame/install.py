"""Put a compiled CPK into a PES install's test slot for an in-game check, and take it out again.

  python scripts/ingame/install.py install GAME CPK   keep the slot's original aside, then put CPK
                                                      in its place (e.g. output/4cc_99_test.cpk)
  python scripts/ingame/install.py revert GAME        put the kept original back

The test slot is one CPK the game already loads last, so whatever it holds overrides every
other CPK; the compiled CPK replaces it whole. That one file is the only game file written: no
save, no DpFileList.bin, no other CPK. GAME is a key of `TEST_SLOTS` below (17 for now); the
install folder comes from game.py's `GAMES`.

Every copy is checked by SHA-256. Both commands refuse while the game runs, and refuse to write
over a slot that holds neither the original (`original_sha256` below) nor the CPK this script
installed last (its hash recorded beside the kept original), so a slot changed by hand or by
another tool is never lost. The kept original lives in `.tmp/ingame/pes<GAME>/` of the
repository (gitignored scratch) and stays there after a revert, ready for the next install.
