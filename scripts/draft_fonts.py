"""Do the drafts draw text only in the app's own fonts? `python scripts/draft_fonts.py`.

plans/core/gui.md "Prototypes before implementation", the Fonts bullet: a draft draws text only
in the font files the app bundles, loaded by `@font-face`, so that what the maintainer reviews
is what egui draws. A family the browser cannot load, or a glyph none of the files has, falls
back to a system font silently (the drafts named Ubuntu, installed nowhere, and were reviewed in
Segoe UI for days). Two checks:

- the rendered pages: every text node of the host and of each tool's view (the Save editor's
  with its first team selected, which shows the Tactics pitch), through Chromium's
  `CSS.getPlatformFontsForNode`, the font each glyph was really drawn in; a font that is not
  an `@font-face` one is reported with the text it drew;
- the sources: canvas text, which no DOM node holds, so every `font`/`font-family` declaration
  and every canvas `.font =` assignment must name the stylesheet's chains (`var(--font-body)`,
  `var(--font-mono)`, `FONT_BODY`) or the icon font, never a family of its own.

A member's own text is the exception: a character the sample saves' names carry that no bundled
file has (`MEMBER_TEXT`) falls back to a system font in the app as well (eframe's system
fallback, kept for what a member types), so a node whose only such characters are those is no
finding.

Needs Python's `playwright` with its Chromium (`playwright install chromium`) and fontTools; a
development tool, not a gate. Exit 1 on any finding, 0 when the drafts draw only bundled fonts.
