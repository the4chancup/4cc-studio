"""`just mutants-diff [base]`: mutation-test only the lines changed since `base`.

Runs `cargo mutants --in-diff` over the diff from `base` (default HEAD) to the working tree,
untracked files included, so a review measures the tests of the code under review rather than the whole
workspace (CONTRIBUTING.md "Testing and verification", "Mutation runs"). The diff goes through
a file because the justfile forbids pipes and redirection in recipe lines.

Each crate the diff mutates gets a cargo-mutants run of its own (`-p <crate>`), one after the
other, not one run for the whole diff: cargo-mutants times a mutant's tests out at a multiple of
the baseline, and one run's baseline tests every crate it mutates, so a hung mutant of a crate
whose tests take two seconds waited out the slowest crate's suite (751 s here at `mutants-diff
95f20eac`). A run costs one more baseline per crate, about a minute. Each crate's results move
to `mutants.diff/<crate>/` when its run ends, and `mutants.diff/missed_all.txt` lists every
crate's survivors.

A crate run whose mutants would cost more than a few minutes locally splits with
`STUDIO_MUTANTS_REMOTE` like `just mutants` does (see `mutants.py`): the
estimate is the baseline plus the per-crate per-mutant costs this machine has
measured (`mutants.estimate_seconds`), so a pes_savefile diff splits while a
one-line `fpc` fix stays local. A crate in `mutants.LOCAL_ONLY_CRATES` never
splits. With `mutants.REMOTE_ONLY` set every mutant runs on the remote,
whatever the estimate.
