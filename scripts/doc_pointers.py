"""Section-pointer check: `doc_pointers.py` (in `just gates`).

A section pointer names a Markdown file and one or more places in it: `` `path.md` "Heading" ``,
with or without the backticks, further titles following after `, `, ` and ` or ` or `
(`` `object_model.md` "Core types", "Player folders" ``). A pointer the line end cuts continues
on the next line, in a `.rs` file on the next comment line. Every pointer in `AGENTS.md`, the
documents under `docs/` and the `.rs` and `.md` files under `crates/` must resolve: its file
exists and holds an anchor the title names. `DECISIONS.md` and `LOG.md` are not checked: they
are append-only, so their old pointers stay as they were written.

The documents name a place by a heading, a bold run-in title (`**Subfolders.**`, anywhere in a
line), the start of a paragraph or list item ("Rules:"), or a table row's first cell (a
glossary term), so each of these is an anchor, with its list marker, bold markers and
backticks removed, and a heading also without its number ("5. Writer" is also "Writer") or a
decision entry's date and scope ("2026-10-27 — core — A window …" is also "A window …"). A
title names an anchor equal to it or starting with it and then a space or `:`, `,`, `.`, so
"Testing" names "Testing and verification". The check is for a pointer whose text is gone
from its file (a section moved to the other tree, renamed or deleted); leniency on the exact
wording costs it nothing there.

A path resolves against, in order, the pointing file's own directory, `docs/`, the repository
root and `docs/plans/`; the first that names an existing file is the pointer's file. The last
base is how the worklog and the other working documents name a plan (`aatf_rules.md`); a
section of the spec is named with its tree (`spec/aatf_rules.md`), so a pointer never leaves
the reader to guess which tree it means. A path that resolves nowhere is a problem only when
the pointer is in `docs/` or `AGENTS.md`, or names `docs/`, `plans/` or `spec/`:
`` `README.md` "Usage" `` in a crate is about that crate.

Code points at the spec alone: a pointer in `crates/` that resolves into `docs/plans/` is a
problem, since a plan describes only what code does not do yet. The one exception is the open
phase, whose sections stay in the plans until it closes although its code is being written:
`OPEN_PHASE_PLANS` lists their files, and the phase's close, which moves the sections, empties it.

A relative Markdown link to a `.md` file (`[core plan](core/README.md)`) must name a file that
exists beside the linking one; its `#anchor` is not checked.
