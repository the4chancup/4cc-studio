"""Gate 4: `cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` over studio_core and every lib crate.

The crate list is derived from the workspace (core plan, "Workspace guardrails" rule 6), so a
new lib crate is checked without anyone remembering to list it. Crates that cannot be checked
for wasm32 by design are named in EXCLUDED with the reason.
