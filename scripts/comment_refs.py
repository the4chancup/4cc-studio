"""List code comments that point at the project's history instead of standing on their own.

    python scripts/comment_refs.py [--count]

CONTRIBUTING.md "Code style", "A comment stands on its own": a comment never cites a plan,
DECISIONS.md, the worklog or the log, a step, a review round or concern, or an agent. This
script reads the comments of every tracked Rust, TOML and Python file (Rust `//`, `///`,
`//!`; TOML and Python `#`) and prints `path:line: kind: text` for each one matching a
pattern below. `--count` prints the number of hits per top-level folder instead. Exit 1 when
anything matches, 0 when nothing does.

The patterns aim at what the rule names, not at every use of the words: "plan" is matched as
a word, so "planned" and "plane" pass; a step is a number, a dot, a number and a letter
(`5.6e`, `0.0.1m2`), so a version (`0.37.0`) or an exponent (`1.3e-5`) passes; a Markdown
file is matched unless its path starts at `spec/`.
